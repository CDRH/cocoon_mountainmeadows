        <p>Over the course  of the past two hundred years, an area in the extreme southwestern corner of  Utah known today as Mountain Meadows has witnessed numerous attempts to fix it  in the public consciousness. The first recorded efforts sought to establish the  place as a valuable natural resource for seasonal overland traffic as early  nineteenth-century traders, trappers, and explorers championed the lush grasses  of this well-watered resting-place, giving it the name <em>las Vegas de Santa  Clara</em>. By mid-century Mormon settlers had arrived in southwestern Utah and the  Anglo moniker Mountain Meadows had replaced the Spanish name in the vernacular  and on maps. But instead of continuing to cultivate its reputation as a welcome  green oasis, a blood-red stain would color the Mountain Meadows after 11 September  1857, when approximately 120 Arkansas men, women, and children of the  Baker-Fancher party, the first southbound wagon train that year, were killed  under mysterious circumstances by members of the local Mormon militia and their  Indian allies. Speculation concerning responsibility for the massacre continued  as fodder for journalists in and out of the Territory. Despite the best efforts  of Church leaders, details from official government investigation reports and  stories of murder printed in newspapers throughout the region and across the  nation combined to transform the Mountain Meadows from a well-known haven to a notorious  site of shame.</p>
		
		<p>One significant problem  that faces Mormon and non-Mormon scholars, both professionals and amateurs, regarding  research into the Mountain Meadows Massacre is ready access to verifiable  sources related to the event; this project aims to remedy that situation while  producing a significant work of collaborative digital history. This archive  contains newspaper account of the event, government investigation reports,  early Mountain Meadows Massacre histories in works of Western Americana,  Apostate and Anti-Mormon publications, as well as works of fiction, drama, and  film. By creating machine-readable electronic texts and digital objects, this  collection of core documents can be searched and browsed by users, providing not  only increased access to key sources, but also potential for the emergence of  previously unforeseen research questions.</p>
