<head>RUMORED MASSACRE ON THE PLAINS.</head>
	<p><seg type="Source" subtype="Word of Mouth">We have just been informed by <persName reg="Brown, John">Judge Brown</persName> of <placeName type="settlement" key="San Bernardino" reg="San Bernardino">San Bernardino</placeName>, who has arrived in town from that city, that a rumor was prevalent there, and had obtained general belief, that <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="Wagon Train">a whole train of emigrants from <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City" reg="Salt Lake City">Salt Lake city</placeName>, for <placeName type="settlement" key="San Bernardino" reg="San Bernardino">San Bernardino</placeName>, composed of twenty-five families, comprising ninety-five persons, men and women,</seg> had been cruelly massacred on the road, between the last settlements in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory" reg="Utah Territory">Utah Territory</placeName> and the boundary of this State.</seg></p>
	<p><seg type="Source" subtype="Word of Mouth">All the property of the company had been carried off, and only the children left, who were picked up on the ground, and were being conveyed to <placeName type="settlement" key="San Bernardino" reg="San Bernardino">San Bernardino</placeName>.</seg></p>
	<p><seg type="Source" subtype="Word of Mouth">This intelligence was brought on by another party who had started from the city after the reported missing company, and who had overtaken the mail carrier in the <geogName type="valley" reg="Cajon Pass">Cajon Pass</geogName>, where he is said to have encamped on Wednesday night.</seg></p>
	<p><seg type="Source" subtype="Word of Mouth">No further particulars are known, nor any names given or any account of the finding and disposition of the bodies. We give the rumor for what it is worth.

	<p><seg type="Source" subtype="Public Mind">Although the rumor was generally believed in <placeName type="settlement" key="San Bernardino" reg="San Bernardino">San Bernardino</placeName>, we confess our unwillingness to credit such a wholesale massacre.</seg></p>
