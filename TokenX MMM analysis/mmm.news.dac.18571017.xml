</dateline><p><seg type="Source" subtype="Word of Mouth">EDITORS ALTA: This morning, while conversing with some immigrants, who have lately arrived via the Plains from Arkansas, and are living within a few miles of this place, I related to them the circumstances of the massacre.  <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="Wagon Train">They immediately informed me that they knew who the parties were. They stated that there were <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="State Affiliation">three, and perhaps four, companies from Arkansas</seg>, while <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="State Affiliation">the balance of the company was made up of Missourians</seg>, who fell in with them; of these latter, they knew nothing, but the Arkansas companies, consisted of <orgName type="wagontrain" key="Fancher" reg="Fancher">Faziers</orgName>, <orgName type="wagontrain" key="Cameron" reg="Cameron">Camerons</orgName> and the two <orgName type="wagontrain" key="Dunlap" reg="Dunlap">Dunlaps</orgName>, and perhaps <orgName type="wagontrain" key="Baker" reg="Baker">Bakers</orgName>. They were from the counties of <placeName rend="county" key="Marion County, AR" reg="Marion County, AR">Marion</placeName>, <placeName rend="county" key="Carrol County, AR" reg="Carrol County, AR"><sic corr="Carrol">Harrol</sic></placeName> and <placeName rend="county" key="Johnson County, AR" reg="Johnson County, AR">Johnson</placeName>.</seg> <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="Route">They say when they saw them, they were encamped six miles from <placeName rend="settlement" key="Salt Lake City" reg="Salt Lake City">Salt Lake City</placeName>, that they had been there for some time, and that they intended to stay there until the weather got cool enough for them to come by the <placeName rend="route" key="Southern Route" reg="Southern Route">South Pass</placeName>, expecting to make a stay of eight weeks all together.</seg> <persName reg="Baker, John T. 'Jack'">Baker</persName> had not arrived there when they left, but as they can learn nothing from him or his company, they concluded that he had fallen in and decided to come into California with these companies.

Why all this concealment?</seg> and <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">in the very face of it the Indians tell what they have done and sell all their spoils to the whites.</seg></seg></seg> <seg type="Reaction" subtype="FederalInvestigation">It will do to lay this blood upon them, but I feel certain that investigation will throw it off.</seg>	P.</seg></p>
