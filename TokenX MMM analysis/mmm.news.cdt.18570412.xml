<head>Terrible Massacre of Emigrants by the Mormons and Indians.</head>
<p>Elsewhere we publish late and exciting news from California, in regard <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">the massacre of 120 American emigrants</seg> who were crossing the plains en route to California. <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">The actual perpetrators of the massacre were no doubt Indians; but the suspicion is, that they were encouraged, instigated, and perhaps led on by Mormons.</seg></p>
<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">The party in question is said to have consisted of about 135 men, women and children, including some forty or forty-five capable of bearing-arms. <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliation">They were from Arkansas</seg>, were well provided, and. had with them quite a stock of horses, mules, and oxen.</seg> <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="route">They had traveled across the plains by the way of Great Salt Lake City, on their way to. Southern California, and had reached <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Location">the rim of the great basin,</seg> about three hundred miles south-west of the <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT" reg="Salt Lake City, UT">Great Salt Lake city</placeName>, and fifty miles from <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT" reg="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>, the most southerly of the Mormon settlements in Utah,</seg> <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">when they were attacked and all destroyed,</seg> <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">with the exception of fifteen young children, who were afterward bought from the Indians by the Mormons.</seg> What we know of this affair, <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Dates">which seems to have taken place about the 10th or 11th of September</seg>, <seg type="Source" subtype="WordofMouth">is derived from statements made by the <orgName type="religious" key="LDS" reg="Church of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints">Mormons</orgName> as to what they had learned about it from the <orgName type="native" reg="Indians">Indians</orgName>, and from-the statements of another party of emigrants who had subsequently passed over the same route, having left <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City" reg="Salt Lake City">Salt Lake City</placeName> ten days later.&#8211;</seg></p>
<p>Suspicion would seem, however, to rest rather upon the extremely bad state of feeling which prevails between the Mormons and emigrants through their country&#8211;and which, in the case of this particular train, would seem to have been especially bitter-than upon any facts positively known.</p>
