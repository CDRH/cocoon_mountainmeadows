	<p>WHEREAS, After a careful examination into all the circumstances connected with the late horrible massacre in Utah Territory, <seg type="Context" subtype="Indian Relations LDS"><seg type="Blame" subtype="Indians LDS Influence"><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS">we firmly believe the atrocious act was perpetrated by the Mormons, and their allies the Indians</seg></seg></seg>; and<lb/></p>
