<head>Complicity of the Mormons in the Late Emigrant Massacre—the Indians Were Tools in the Hands of the Saints</head>
<p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD.</p>
<p>The late horrible massacre of <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="Route"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">more than one hundred
emigrants</seg> on the Spanish trail from Utah to California</seg>,
deserves more than a passing notice at the hands of the press. The <seg type="Source" subtype="UnattributedPublishedAccount">San Francisco papers give the substance of several statements, tending to show the <orgName type="religious" key="LDS" reg="Church of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints">Mormons</orgName> were
cognizant of the massacre and probably instigated it.</seg> The
fact is undoubtedly this: <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">The Mormons must have planned
and executed it with the Indians, or it could not have
occurred.</seg> The writer has spent a year in Utah, and during
the spring of 1855 passed over <placeName type="route" key="Spanish Trail" reg="Spanish Trail">the route from Salt Lake
City to Los Angeles, California</placeName>, in command of a detachment
of <orgName type="military" key="United States Army" reg="United States Army">United States troops</orgName> Previous to this march he
had seen several months service among the <orgName type="native" reg="Pahvant">Indians</orgName> who
occupy the country in the vicinity of the late massacre.
<seg type="Context" subtype="IndianRelationsLDS"><orgName type="native" reg="Pahvant">These Indians</orgName> have for years been under the tutelage of the Mormons.
Their chiefs, <persName reg="Kanosh">Canoshe</persName>, <persName reg="Ammon">Ammon</persName>, and others,
are members of the <orgName type="religious" key="LDS" reg="Church of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints">Mormon church</orgName>. Their villages are
in close proximity to the Mormon towns, and their fields of
grain are adjacent to those of the Mormons. Missionaries
reside constantly with the Indians and control their movement. In the event of the death of a chief, his successor
is always the one designated by the Mormons. The
Indians are armed with rifles and have an abundance of
ammunition supplied by the <orgName type="religious" key="LDS" reg="Church of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints">Mormons</orgName>, and these supplies  
are purchased with United States money, supplied to <persName reg="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> in his capacity of Superintendent of Indian Affairs. <seg type="Context" subtype="IndianRelationsUS">The whole instruction of the Mormon missionaries has been that the Americans area weak and infirm nation
compared with the Mormons, and the natural enemies of
the Indian.</seg></seg> <seg type="Context" subtype="IndianRelationsUS">For years past no small party of Americans
has ever traveled this route without assuming the character
and name of Mormons as an absolutely necessary
precaution to pass through safely. </seg>The <orgName type="religious" key="LDS" reg="Church of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints">Mormon</orgName> settlements
stretch from <placeName type="Fillmore, UT" key="Fillmore, UT" reg="Fillmore, UT">Fillmore City</placeName> to the <geogName type="waterway" reg="Vegas River">Vegas river</geogName>, at intervals
of a few miles; and <seg type="Context" subtype="IndianRelationsLDS">so close is the connection between the
Mormon people and the Indians, that it is absolutely impossible for a train to be attacked anywhere on this route
without the knowledge and consent of the Mormons.</seg> I beg
leave to say that this is no charge hastily made—no inconsiderate evidence—but an incontestable fact; and its
truth can be attested by hundreds of people in California
who have traveled the route, and called themselves Mormon
to avoid a fate similar to that of <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">the hundred and
eighteen men, women and children slaughtered at Mountain
Meadows.</seg>
</p><p>The writer of this letter camped two days at <geogName type="feature" reg="Mountain Meadows">Mountain Meadows</geogName>, two days on the <geogName type="waterway" reg="Santa Clara River">Santa Clara</geogName>, and two days on the <geogName type="waterway" reg="Muddy River">Muddy</geogName>. <seg type="Context" subtype="IndianRelationsUS">At the approach of the troops the Mormon
missionaries left the Indian tribes and went to the nearest
Mormon settlement, after instructing the Indians to attack
the troops. Nothing but an exhibition of superior strength
and constant vigilance prevented repeated attacks. Several
times the mules and horses were driven oft by the Indians, and as often recovered. </seg>The chiefs of the tribes
on the <geogName type="waterway" reg="Virgin River">Virgin</geogName> and <geogName type="waterway" reg="Muddy River">Muddy rivers</geogName> told the writer of their
instructions to attack the troops, and of the representations
of the Mormons that the Americans were a weak
people and the enemy of the Indian. <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">I repeat that it is
not reasonable to suppose that this massacre could have
been committed without the complicity of the Mormons.</seg>
<seg type="Massacre" subtype="Rescue Attempt">The circumstances of the case show that they could have
prevented it, or rescued the greater portion of the train,
as the fight lasted many hours, and they were made
aware of it by expresses.</seg></p>
<p>The facts here stated with reference to the Instructions of the Mormon missionaries, and the march of the troops,
have been on file in the <orgName type="governmental" key="War Department" reg="War Department">War Department</orgName>, in the form of
an official report, more than three years.</p>
