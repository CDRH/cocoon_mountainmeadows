<p><seg type="Source" subtype="Reprinted">In the letter of an occasional correspondent <unclear /> Callville in yesterday's
Bulletin</seg> it was intimated that the Mormons were exciting the United States authorities to <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">punish the Indians for the massacre known by the above name</seg>. <seg type="Context" subtype="IndianRelationsLDS">The Mormons having their own troubles with the Indians</seg> are <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">now accusing those collected in the neighborhood of <geogName type="waterway" key="Muddy River">Muddy
river</geogName> of being the murderers, and in possession of the cattle and other plunder obtained by his crime.</seg>  It will be remembered that <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Dates">in 1857</seg> <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">a large train of emigrants</seg> <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas">from <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName></seg> were attacked <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Location">at <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">Mountain Meadow</geogName></seg> <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">by a band of Indians</seg> or <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS">white men</seg>, and <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">every adult, numbering 141 persons of both sexes, slain</seg> and <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">a large quantity of stock, wagons, carriages, jewelry, clothing and other property carried off</seg>.  <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">After the massacre, 18 children, from eight years of age down to eight months, were picked up amongst the bushes into which they had crawled for shelter.</seg> <seg type="Source" subtype="Attributed_Lynch"><persName key="Lynch, James">James Lynch</persName>, formerly Superintendent of the United States post at <orgName type="military" key="Camp Floyd">Camp Floyd</orgName>, has informed us </seg>that he was instructed by the United States authorities to inquire
into this matter while stationed at the above post, and he had communications

These children were found by the United States authorities, in <placeName type="settlement" key="Santa Clara, CA">Santa Clara</placeName>, in 1859, in miserable condition, and were given up to our informant. The eldest, a sharp, intelligent child 10 years old, named <persName key="Dunlap, Mary">Mary Dunlap</persName>, remembered distinctly the occurrences of two years before, and pointed out to Mr. <persName key="Lynch, James">Lynch</persName> the man who had taken part in the massacre.  <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils"><persName key="Dunlap, Mary">Mary Dunlap</persName> also testified to articles of dress and jewelry worn by <persName key="Lee, John D.">John De Lee</persName>'s wife and other persons as being part of the plunder which she recognized; also carriages and wagons which formed part of the train then in possession of the Mormons with whom she had been living.</seg></seg>  <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS">Over 30 witnesses testified to facts proving the guilt of the Mormons</seg> in this matter before Judge <persName key="Cradelbaugh, John">Cradlebaugh</persName> and <persName key="Eckels, Delana R.">Eckell</persName>, Territorial Judges in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>.</p>
