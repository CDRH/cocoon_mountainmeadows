<p><hi rend="italic">State of Nevada, County of Lincoln 88:</hi></p>
  
<p>Personally appeared before me, <persName key="Milller, Peter B.">Peter B. Miller</persName>.  Clerk of Court of the Seventh Judicial District of the <placeName type="state" key="Nevada">State of Nevada</placeName>, <persName key="Klingensmith, Philip">Philip Klingon Smith</persName>, who being duly sworn, on his oath says: My name is <persName key="Klingensmith, Philip">Philip Klingon Smith</persName>: I reside in the <placeName type="county" key="Lincoln County, NV">County of Lincoln</placeName>, in the <placeName type="state" key="Nevada">State of Nevada</placeName>; I resided at <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName> in the <placeName type="county" key="Iron County, UT">County of Iron</placeName>, in the <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Territory of Utah</placeName>, from A.D. 1852 to A.D. 1859; I was residing at <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName> at the time of the massacre <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Location">at <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">Mountain Meadows</geogName>, in said <placeName type="settlement" key="Utah Territory">Territory of Utah</placeName></seg>; I had heard that <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="Route">a company of emigrants was on its way from <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>, bound for <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName>; said company arrived at said <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>, tarried <choice><sic>ther</sic><corr>there</corr></choice> one day, and passed on for <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName>;</seg> after said company had left <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>, the militia was called out for the purpose of committing acts of hostility against them; said call was a regular military call from the superior officers to the subordinate officers and privates of the regiment at <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName> and vicinity, composing part of the militia of the <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Territory of Utah</placeName>; I do not recollect the number of the regiment.  I was at that time the Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints at <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>; Isaac C. Haight was President over said church at <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>, and the southern settlements in said Territory; my position as bishop is subordinate
    to that of said President.  <persName key="Dame, William H.">W.H. Dame</persName> was President of said church at <placeName type="settlement" key="Parowan, UT">Parowan</placeName>, in said <placeName type="county" key="Iron County">Iron County</placeName>.  Said Dame was also colonel of said regiment; and <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Isaac C. Haight</persName> was lieutenant-colonel of said regiment, and said <persName key="Lee, John D.">John D. Lee</persName>, of <placeName type="settlement" key="Harmony, UT">Harmony</placeName>, in said <placeName type="county" key="Iron County, UT">Iron County</placeName>, was Major.  Said regiment was duly ordered to muster, armed and equipped as the law directs and prepared for field operations.  I had no command nor office in said regiment on the expedition which resulted in said company's being massacred
<seg type="Massacre" subtype="Location">at the <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">mountain Meadows</geogName> in said <placeName type="county" key="Iron County, UT">county of Iron</placeName></seg>.  About four days after said
company of emigrants had left <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName> that portion of said regiment then mustered at <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName> took up its line of march in pursuit of them.  About two days after said company had left <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>, Lieutenant-Colonel <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">I.C. Haight</persName> expressed in my presence a desire that said company might be permitted to pass on their way in peace; but afterwards he told me that he had orders to kill all of said company of emigrants <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">except the little children</seg>. I do not know whether said headquarters meant that regiment headquarters at <placeName type="settlement" key="Parowan, UT">Parowan</placeName> or the headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief at <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>.  When the said company got to <placeName type="settlement" key="Iron Creek, UT">Iron Creek</placeName>, about twenty miles from <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>, Captain <persName key="White, Joel">Joel White</persName> started for the <placeName type="settlement" key="Piato Creek, UT">Piato Creek Settlement</placeName>, through which the said company would pass for the purpose of influencing
the people to permit said company to pass on their way in peace.  <seg type="Massacre" subtype="RescueAttempt">I asked and obtained permission of said <persName key="White, Joel">White</persName> to go with him to aid him in trying to save life.  When we got about three miles from <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>, we met Major <persName key="Lee, John D.">J.D. Lee</persName>, who asked us where we were going.  I replied that we were going to try to prevent the killing of the emigrants. <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> replied: <q>"I have something to say about that."</q>  <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> was at the time on his way to <placeName type="settlement" key="Parowan, UT">Parowan</placeName>, the headquarters of Colonel <persName key="Dame, William H.">Dame</persName>.  Said <persName key="White, Joel">White</persName> and I went to <geogName type="waterway" key="Pinto Creek">Pinto Creek</geogName>; remained there one night, and the next day returned to <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>, meeting said company of emigrants at <geogName type="waterway" key="Iron Creek">Iron Creek</geogName>.  Before reaching <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName> we met one <persName key="Allen, Ira">Ira Allen</persName>, who told us that "<q>The decree had passed devoting said company to destruction."</q></seg>
After the fight had been going on three or four days a message from Major <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> reached <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>, who stated that the fight had not been altogether successful, upon which Lieutenant-Colonel <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> ordered out a reinforcement.  At this time I was ordered out by Captain <persName key="Higbee, John M.">John M. <choice><sic>Hibgy</sic><corr>Higbee</corr></choice></persName> who ordered me to muster <q>"armed and
equipped as the law directs."</q>  It was a matter of life or death to me to muster or not,
and I mustered with the reinforcing troops. It was at this time that Lieutenant-Colonel
<persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> said to me that it was the orders from headquarters that all but the little
children of said company were to be killed. Said <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> had at the time just returned from headquarters at <placeName type="settlement" key="Parowan, UT">Parowan</placeName>, where a military council had been held.  There had been a like council held at <placeName type="settlement" key="Parowan, UT">Parowan</placeName> previous to that, at which were present Colonel <persName key="Dame, William H.">Dame</persName>, Lieutenant-Colonel <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">I.C. Haight</persName> and Major <persName key="Lee, John D.">John D. Lee</persName>.  The result of this first council was the calling out of said regiment for the purpose already stated.  The reinforcement aforesaid was marched to <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Location">the <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">Mountain Meadows</geogName></seg>, and there formed a junction with the main body.  Major <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> massed all the troops at a spring and made a speech to them, saying that his orders from <q>"headquarters were to kill the entire company except the small children."</q>  I was not in the ranks at that time, but on one side talking to a man named <persName key="Slade, Willilam Rufus">Slade</persName>, and could not have seen a paper in Major <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName>'s hands. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">Said <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> then sent a flag of truce to the emigrant<cb n="2" /> camp, offering said emigrants that <q>"if they hold down their arms he would protect them."</q>  They accordingly laid down their arms, came out from their camp, and delivered themselves up to the said <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName>.  The women and children were then, by the order of said <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName>, separated from the men and were marched ahead of the men.  After the said emigrants had marched about a half mile towards <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName> the order was
given to shoot them down.</seg>  At that time said <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> was at the head of the column.  I was in the rear.  I did not hear <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> give the order to fire, but heard it from under
officers as it was passed down the column. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">The emigrants were then and there shot
down, <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">except seventeen little children, which I immediately took into my charge.</seg>  I do not know the total number of said company I did not stop to count the dead.</seg>  <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">I immediately put the little children in baggage-wagons belonging to the regiment and took
them to <persName key="Hamblin, Jacob">Hamlin</persName>'s ranch and from there to <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>, and procured them homes among the people.  <persName key="Willis, John">J. Willis</persName> and <persName key="Murdy, Samuel">S. Murdy</persName> assisted me in taking charge of said children.</seg> On the evening of the massacre <persName key="Dame, William H.">W.H. Dame</persName> and Lieut. <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">I.C. Haight</persName> came to <persName key="Hamblin, Jacob">Hamlin</persName>'s where I had the said children, and fell into a dispute, in the course of which said <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> told Colonel <persName key="Dame, William H.">Dame</persName> that if he was going to report of the killing of said emigrant he
should not have ordered it done.  I do not know when or where said troops were disbanded.
About two weeks after said massacre occurred said Major <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> (who was also
Indian agent) went to <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName> and, as I believe, reported said fight and its results to the commander-in-chief: I was not present at either of the before mentioned
councils, nor at any council connected with the aforesaid military operations or with said company.  I gave no orders except to those connected with the saving of the children, and those after the massacre had occurred, and said orders were given as bishop and not in a military sense.  At the time of the firing of the first volley I discharged my piece.  I did not fire afterwards, though several subsequent volleys were fired.  <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">After the first fire was delivered I at once set about saving the children.  I commenced to gather up the children before the firing had ceased.</seg> I have made the foregoing statements before the above entitled Court for the reason that I believe that I would be assassinated should I attempt to make the same before any court in the <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Territory of Utah</placeName>.  After said <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> returned from <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>, as aforesaid, said <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> told me that he had reported fully to the President, meaning the commander-in-chief, the fight <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Location">at <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">Mountain Meadows</geogName></seg> and the killing of said emigrants. <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> was at that time commander-in-chief of the Militia of the <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Territory of Utah</placeName>; and further deponent saith not.</p>
