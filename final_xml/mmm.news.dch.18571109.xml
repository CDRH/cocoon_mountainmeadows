<head>Horrible Massacre of Emigrants&#8212;Over 100 Persons Killed.</head>

<p><seg type="Source" subtype="Christian">A letter from <persName key="Christian, J. Ward">J. O. Ward</persName> to the <orgName type="newspaper" key="Los ANgeles Star">Los Angelos <hi rend="italic">Star</hi></orgName>, dated <placeName type="settlement" key="San Bernardino, CA">San Bernardino</placeName>, Oct. 4th, 1857, states that an entire train of Emigrants <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationMissouri">from <placeName type="state" key="Missouri">Missouri</placeName></seg> and <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas"><placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName></seg> <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="Route">bound to <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName> by way of <geogName type="waterway" key="Great Salt Lake">Great Salt Lake</geogName></seg>, <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">had been massacred by Indians</seg> <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Location">at the <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">Mountain Meadows</geogName>, which are on or near <geogName type="feature" key="Great Basin">the rim of the Great Basin</geogName>, and some distance South of the most Southern Mormon settlements</seg>.  <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Dates">The massacre took place about the 10th or 11th of September</seg>.  <seg type="Source" subtype="Indians">Mr. <persName key="Christian, J. Ward">Ward</persName> says he first obtained his information from the Indians</seg>.  The account, no doubt much exaggerated, if not altogether untrue, is as follows:</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Source" subtype="Christian"><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">The company consisted of one hundred and thirty or one hundred and thirty-five, women and children, and included some forty or forty-five capable of bearing arms.</seg>  <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">They were in possession of quite an amount of stock, consisting of horses mules and oxen.</seg>  <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently"><seg type="Source" subtype="Indians">The encampment was attacked about daylight in the morning, so say the Indians, by the combined forces of all the various tribes immediately in the section of the country</seg>.  <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">It appears that the majority of them were slain at the first onset made by the Indians.</seg></seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Source" subtype="Christian"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">The remaining force formed themselves into the best position their circumstances would allow; but before they could make the necessary arrangements for protecting themselves from the arrows, there were but few left who were able to bear arms.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Source" subtype="Christian"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">After having corralled their wagons and dug a ditch for their protection, they continued to fire upon the Indians for one or two days; but the Indians had so secreted themselves that, according to their own statement, there was not one of them killed, and but few wounded.</seg>  <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">They (the emigrants) then sent out a flag of truce, borne by a little girl, and gave themselves up to the mercy of the savages</seg>, who immediately rushed in and slaughtered all of them, with <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">the exception of fifteen infant children that have since been purchased, with some difficulty, by the Mormon interpreters</seg>.</seg></p>

<p>The causes which led to the massacre are reported to be that when the train camped at an Indian village near <placeName type="settlement" key="Fillmore City, UT">Fillmore City</placeName>, <seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeIndian">the emigrants not only cheated the natives badly in trading with them</seg>, but <seg type="Encounter" subtype="Poison">they put strychnine in a dead ox for the purpose of poisoning the Indians, and also put poison in the water which stands in pools.  This occasioned several deaths among the Indians within a few days after the departure of the train, whereupon the Indians rallied, selected a place of attack, and took terrible vengeance</seg>.  <seg type="Source" subtype="Attributed_TannerMathews">Mr. <persName key="Christian, J. Ward">W.</persName> says he obtained the statement of the causes of the massacre from Elders <persName key="William Mathews">Matthews</persName> and <persName key="Hyde, Bill">Hyde</persName>, who were in <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Great Salt Lake City</placeName> at the time this train was there recruiting their fit-out, and were on their way to <placeName type="settlement" key="San Bernardino, CA">San Bernardino</placeName> when the murders were committed, but several days' journey in the rear of the emigrants.</seg></p>
