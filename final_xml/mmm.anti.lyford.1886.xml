<head>THE MOUNTAIN MEADOWS MASSACRE OF 1857.</head>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">THE</hi> following is probably the most complete and truthful account of this dreadful event ever published. It was furnished the "Chicago Tribune" by a special correspondent in January, 1875. It is altogether too valuable an historic paper to be lost. The details were gathered with the utmost care, and are related with the strictest regard for accuracy. Many of these details I have also heard from old residents of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, some of whom had personal knowledge of the same. I have thought it best to present the whole story to the world in this form, as given by the narrator, with only a few slight abbreviations.</p>

<p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">AUTHENTIC HISTORY OF THE HORRIBLE SLAUGHTER OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE EMIGRANTS.</hi></hi></p>

<p>One cannot gain an intelligent idea of any great event without knowing the causes by which it was produced. Waterloo could never be understood if only the incidents of the battle were narrated.</p>

<pb n="272" xml:id="mmm.anti.lyford.1886.279"/>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">The causes which led to the Mountain Meadows massacre are interwoven with the fundamental principles of the strange religion of the Mormons. Place yourself in sympathy with these principles, and you can obtain a faint conception of the motives which actuated those whose hands bear the dreadful stain. Plunder, lust, and personal animosity would never have prompted men to commit such a cruel, merciless slaughter, had not the teachings of a fanatical religious belief sanctioned the crime.</seg></p>

<p>The good precepts of the Mormon faith render the people generous, kind, hospitable. <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">The black precepts are all embodied in this one fiendish act.</seg></p>

<p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">AT THE OUTSET</hi></hi>

let me state that I have no desire to make history. My duty is not to create events, but to record them. Where authorities cannot be cited&#8212;where I have not the names of authentic men to corroborate statements&#8212;I shall always mention the fact. Some of the incidents are probably fictitious; of such I shall state that they are only rumors: yet I shall record no rumors which are not believed by those who ought to know the truth.</p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">Seventeen years of mysterious darkness <choice><orig>overshad-

<pb n="273" xml:id="mmm.anti.lyford.1886.280"/>

ows</orig><reg>overshadows</reg></choice> the crime, and where the truth cannot be separated from the falsehoods, both will be given, and time and the courts of justice will distinguish between them. I have received the following "causes" from the lips of Mormons. From the "first presidency" down to the humblest farmer, I have diligently sought out reasons. While they all attempt to soften the wiry edge of public opinion by mentioning the provocations which brought on the deed, I must bear witness that

<hi rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">THE MORMONS REPUDIATE THE CRIME.</hi></hi></seg></p>

<p>From no one have I obtained a single word of approval, or aught that could be construed into a sanction, of the massacre. For several weeks I have been mingling with all the various ranks and classes, and, in justice to myself, I must emphatically deny that this great crime ought to rest upon the shoulders of the people. <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDSZealots">No denunciation can be too severe for those who planned and urged on the crime; but do not infer that all this people are guilty.</seg></p>

<p>The revelations of <persName key="Smith, Joseph">Joseph Smith</persName> made the Mormons the one chosen people of God. "Gentiles" and "Babylonians" are terms which indicate that outsiders have no rights which ought to be respected.

<pb n="274" xml:id="mmm.anti.lyford.1886.281"/>

<seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDSZealots">As the Israelites, the, ancient people of God, dealt with the Egyptians, the Philistines, or the tribes that opposed them, so, if necessary, might the Mormons deal with "outs." This "cause" had much to do with the massacre. A prayerful assemblage were "counseled" to the deed, and prayerful men led on the slaughter. From <persName key="Lee, John D.">John D. Lee</persName>'s conversation I have no doubt the story is true which says "he waved his sword above his head after the massacre, and shouted: This day has the name of Israel's God been glorified!'"</seg></p>

<p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">AVENGING A PROPHET'S BLOOD.</hi></hi></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDSRetribution"><seg type="Context" subtype="LDSPersecution"><persName key="Smith, Joseph">Joseph Smith</persName> is regarded by the Mormons as the Saviour is by other Christian denominations. The Mormons believe in Jesus Christ, but not more firmly than in this latter day prophet. Both suffered martyrdom at the hands of infuriated mobs. The murderers of <persName key="Smith, Joseph">Joseph Smith</persName> are regarded with the same intense hatred that would attach to those of our Saviour, had he been crucified in this age and day. <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationMissouri">One part of the great emigrant-train came from the portion of <placeName type="state" key="Missouri">Missouri</placeName></seg> from which the Mormons had been driven, and at least one person claimed to have been at <placeName type="state" key="Illinois">Illinois</placeName> when the prophet was killed. It is

currently believed that one of the emigrants swung a pistol above his head, and swore that it helped kill "<persName key="Smith, Joseph">Joe Smith</persName>," and was then loaded for "Old <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham</persName>." I have asked Mormons whether their religion would exonerate the man who should kill the desperado that boasted of murdering the prophet, and they bluntly answered "Yes."</seg></seg></p>

<p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">AN APOSTLE'S MURDERERS.</hi></hi></p>

<p>A well-known tenet of the Mormon faith is, that husbands may forsake wives, and wives may desert husbands, for religon's sake. To gain admission into the one true Church is worth infinitely more than family ties. At <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName> a gray-haired man was pointed out to me, with the boastful assertion: "There is a man who left a wife and four children in England, that he might join the Mormons in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>." The results of this accursed doctrine are prominently connected with the bloody events of the massacre.</p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="PrattMurder"><persName key="Pratt, Parley P.">Parley P. Pratt</persName> was a bright and shining light among the early Mormons. He was one of the "Twelve Apostles," and his influence was powerful and wide spread. He practiced the doctrine he preached, and one of his wives, <persName key="McLean Pratt, Eleanor">Eleanor M'Lean</persName>, was the wife of an <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName> man.

Pining for her children, she induced <persName key="Pratt, Parley P.">Parley P. Pratt</persName> to return to <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName> to obtain them.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="PrattMurder">Yet the Mormons see nothing criminal in <persName key="Pratt, Parley P.">Parley P. Pratt</persName>'s action, and follow, with dire vengeance, the friends of <persName key="McLean, Hector">M'Lean</persName>. <persName key="Pratt, Parley P.">Pratt</persName> was a martyr. His autobiography is selling rapidly through <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> at present. The wife, <persName key="McLean Pratt, Eleanor">Eleanor Pratt</persName>, died three weeks ago in <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>, and a young man, who was her son and <persName key="McLean, Hector">M'Lean</persName>'s, followed with the mourners. <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas">The emigrant train contained several persons who came from <persName key="McLean, Hector">M'Lean</persName>'s neighborhood.</seg> At least one man was believed to have been interested in the killing of Apostle <persName key="Pratt, Parley P.">Parley P. Pratt</persName>. You see the connection.</seg></p>

<p>The very groundwork of the Mormon theocracy rests upon unbounded reverence for President <persName key="Young, Brigham">Young</persName>, their prophet, seer, and revelator. It is charged that the emigrants wove his name into vulgar songs, which were chanted through the streets.</p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="LDSPersecution"><seg type="Encounter" subtype="Slander"><seg type="Blame" subtype="EmigrantBehavior">There is, or was, a Territorial law prohibiting profanity. Some of the emigrants were said to be terribly profane, and upon entering a town invariably inquired: "Where is your d&#8212;d old bishop, or

president?" Their profanity at last caused the authorities to attempt to arrest them at <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>. Resistance was made, and the authorities were compelled to abandon the attempt.</seg></seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="EmigrantBehavior">Again, it is told that a teamster, in passing through the streets of <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar</placeName>, brought his heavy whiplash down among Widow Evans's chickens and killed two. <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> says, that while camped two miles beyond the town they tore down and burned fifteen rods of fence, and turned their stock upon the standing grain.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently"><seg type="Blame" subtype="EmigrantBehavior"><seg type="Encounter" subtype="Poison">It is rumored that at Corn Creek they poisoned a beef, or a spring, or a running stream, and the Indians suffered from the effects.

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="UtahWar"><hi rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">THE GREAT CAUSE,</hi></hi>

however, was, that <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">Albert Sidney Johnson</persName>'s army was entering <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, and that Mormons were marshaling to oppose him with force and arms. The United States was considered as an enemy, and its subjects were treated as foes.</seg> Practically, <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">the Territory</placeName> was under martial law, and the Nauvoo Legion drilled

is said to have had its share in urging on the deed. <seg type="Context" subtype="LDSApostates">Certain disaffected Mormons joined the train to go to <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName>. When their bodies were found after the massacre it is said they were clothed in their endowment shirts.

<p>I give all the reasons I ever heard assigned, because, when the provocation is all summed up, there

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">In rebuttal, abundant proof can be furnished to show that the company was orderly, highly respectable, and composed principally of quiet, Sabbath-loving, Christian people.

they found, to their great surprise, that nothing could be procured of the Mormons for love or money. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">Their cash, their cattle, their immense wealth</seg>, could not purchase provisions enough to keep them from starving.

He was Governor of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, one of the Territories  of the United States, and certainly he ought to have permitted citizens of the Union to purchase necessary provisions while passing peaceably through his confines. As it was, they would have died of starvation had they not been massacred, though there was an unusually abundant harvest that year. As a climax to this inhospitable reception they were peremptorily ordered to break camp and move away from <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>.</seg></p>

had preceded them in the person of <persName key="Smith, George A.">George A.

Riding swiftly, his fleet horse far outstripped the slow-moving emigrant-train. At every settlement he preached to the Mormons, and gave strict orders to sell no food or grain to emigrants, under pain of excommunication. To the earnest, sincere Mormon, death is preferable to being "cut off" from the privileges of his religion. At least three men have told me that <persName key="Smith, George A.">George A.

<persName key="Smith, George A.">George A. Smith</persName> and his companion met the emigrants, and camped side by side with them.
