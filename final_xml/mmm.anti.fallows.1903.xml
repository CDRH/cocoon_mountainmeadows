<head type="source">THE IMMORAL CHARACTERS OF THE MORMON LEADERS IN MISSOURI AND ILLINOIS.</head>

<p>Theft and robbery from Gentiles were among the chief virtues of Mormonism. In September, 1831, <persName key="Smith, Joseph">Joseph Smith</persName> had the following revelation: "Behold it is said in my laws and forbidden to get in debt to thine enemies, but behold it is not said at any time that the Lord should not take where he pleases and pay as seemeth good. Wherefore, as ye are agents, and ye are on the Lord's errand, whatever ye do according to the will of the Lord is the Lord's business, and he hath set you to provide for his saints in these last days that they may obtain an inheritance in the Land of Zion." (Doct. and Cov.) This revelation has been faithfully attended to, as abundant evidence goes to show. To trace the history of Mormonism from <placeName type="settlement" key="Kirtland, OH">Kirtland</placeName>, <placeName type="state" key="Ohio">Ohio</placeName>, to Far West and <placeName type="settlement" key="Nauvoo, IL">Nauvoo</placeName>, and its thirty years' reign in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> is to unfold the direful picture of these crimes. These depredations have been committed from the first under the full knowledge and sanction of the church authorities, and the booty used for the benefit of the church, as the following statements clearly show:</p>

<p>"To His Excellency <persName key="Boggs, Lilburn">L. W. Boggs</persName>:</p>

<p>"Sir:&#8212;I find, by inquiry, that of all the enormities we have heard charged against these people (the Mormons), many of which charges we looked upon as the offspring of prejudice on the part of our citizens, the half has not yet been told! There is no crime, from treason down to petty larceny, but these people, or a majority of them, have been guilty of, all, too, under the counsel of <persName key="Smith, Joseph">Joseph Smith, Jr.</persName>, the Prophet! They have committed treason, murder, arson, burglary, robbery, larceny and perjury! They have societies formed under the most binding covenants in form, and the most horrid oaths, to circumvent the laws, and put them at defiance, and to plunder, and burn, and murder, and divide the spoils for the use of the church. This is what they call Danite Society.</p>

<p><persName key="Pratt, Sarah Marinda Bates">Mrs. Pratt</persName>, wife of <persName key="Pratt, Orson">Orson Pratt</persName>, said: "<persName key="Smith, Joseph">Joseph Smith</persName> was a bad man, without doubt&#8212;wicked, sensual, devilish. I exceedingly fear and tremble for the weak and uneducated of my sex; for an unprincipled libertine, sensualist and debauchee, of such unbounded prophetic influence, in a community like this, may utterly ruin hundreds of pious, unsuspecting females, under the potent dictum of a 'Thus saith the Lord.'"</p>

<p>General <persName key="Bennett, John C.">Bennett</persName>, the commander of the Nauvoo Legion, and many other persons, men and women, who were the former intimate associates of <persName key="Smith, Joseph">Smith</persName>, made affidavits before the death of the prophet, regarding his truculent and lecherous life.</p>

<p><persName key="Harris, Martin">Martin Harris</persName>, the first scribe of the Book of Mormons, and a witness to the plate, but not one of the constituent members of the church, was afterward catalogued by the Mormons with "negroes who wear white skins, and he and his associates are so far beneath contempt that a notice of them would be far too great a sacrifice for a gentleman to make." He was consigned to the infernal regions. A document drafted by <persName key="Rigdon, Sidney">Sidney Rigdon</persName>, and subscribed by eighty-four " Mormons, addressed to <persName key="Cowdery, Oliver">Oliver Cowdery</persName>, <persName key="Whitmer, David">David Whitmer</persName>, <persName key="Whitmer, John">John Whitmer</persName>, <persName key="Phelps, W. W.">W. W. Phelps</persName> and <persName key="Johnson, Lyman E.">Lyman E. Johnson</persName>, exhibits these witnesses and apostles and their associates to have been unmitigated scamps. Some of them were charged with being "connected with a gang of counterfeiters, thieves, liars and blacklegs of the deepest dye," and with "cheating and defrauding the saints."</p>

<p>Mr. <persName key="Stenhouse, T. B. H.">Stenhouse</persName> says: "The Lord could not well have chosen a more despicable set of thieves and liars than they were&#8212;taking the testimony of their brethren as evidence. Mormonism did little for them in the way of reformation and grace. They must have been 'a hard lot' before they accepted the new revelation."</p>

<p><persName key="Rigdon, Sidney">Sidney Rigdon</persName> was, after the death of <persName key="Smith, Joseph">Joseph Smith</persName>, charged with the determination to "rule or ruin the church." And in the language of the reporter, "Elder <persName key="Young, Brigham">Young</persName> arose and delivered <persName key="Rigdon, Sidney">Sidney Rigdon</persName> over to the buffetings of Satan in the name of the Lord; and all the people said&#8212;Amen."</p>

You know it is only figurative. I mean, you have my most supreme affections. O, that I had yours as truly! May I not hope that it will be so? At all events, be my friend, my best friend.

<p>The following is the confession of the chief participant in the massacre:</p>

<p>"My name is <persName key="Lee, John D.">John Doyle Lee</persName>.

in the faith. My parents died while I was still a child, and my boyhood was one of trial and hardship. I married <persName key="Woolsey, Agatha Ann">Agatha Ann Woolsey</persName> in 1833, and moved to <placeName type="county" key="Fayette County, IL">Fayette county</placeName>, <placeName type="state" key="Illinois">Illinois</placeName>, on Sucker creek. There I became wealthy. In 1836 I became acquainted with some traveling Mormon preachers. I bought, read and believed the Book of Mormon. I sold my property in <placeName type="state" key="Illinois">Illinois</placeName> and moved to <placeName type="state" key="Missouri">Missouri</placeName> in 1837, where I joined the Mormon church and became intimately acquainted with <persName key="Smith, Joseph">Joseph Smith</persName>, <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> and other leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I was subsequently initiated into the order of Danites at its first formation. The members of this order were solemnly sworn to obey the orders of the priesthood of the Mormon church, to do any and all things as commanded. The 'Destroying Angels' of the Mormon church were selected from this organization. I took an active part as a Mormon soldier, and it was the recurring conflicts between the people and the Mormons which made <placeName type="county" key="Jackson County, MO">Jackson county</placeName>, <placeName type="state" key="Missouri">Missouri</placeName>, historic ground. When the Mormons were expelled from <placeName type="state" key="Missouri">Missouri</placeName>, I was one of the first to settle at <placeName type="settlement" key="Nauvoo, IL">Nauvoo</placeName>, <placeName type="state" key="Illinois">Ill.</placeName>, where I took an active part in all that was done by the church or city. I had charge of the construction of many public buildings there, and was the policeman and bodyguard of <persName key="Smith, Joseph">Joseph Smith</persName> at <placeName type="settlement" key="Nauvoo, IL">Nauvoo</placeName>. After his death I held the same position to <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName>, who succeeded <persName key="Smith, Joseph">Joseph Smith</persName> as prophet, priest and revelator in the church. I was recorder for the quorum of seventy, head clerk of the church, and organized the priesthood in the Order of Seventy. I took all the degrees of the Endowment House, and stood high in the priesthood. I traveled extensively throughout the United States as a Mormon missionary, and acted as trader and financial agent of the church. From the death of <persName key="Smith, Joseph">Joseph Smith</persName> until the settlement at <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName> I was one of the locating committee that selected sites for the

various towns and cities in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah territory</placeName>. I held many offices in the territory, and was a member of the Mormon Legislature, and was Probate Judge of <placeName type="county" key="Washington County, UT">Washington County</placeName>, <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>. <seg type="Context" subtype="Polygamy">Immediately after <persName key="Smith, Joseph">Joseph Smith</persName> received the revelation concerning polygamy I was informed of its doctrines by said <persName key="Smith, Joseph">Joseph Smith</persName> and the apostles. I believed in the doctrine, and have been sealed to eighteen women, three of whom are sisters, and one was the mother of three of my wives. I was sealed to this old woman for her soul's salvation.</seg> <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">I was an honored man in the church, flattered and regarded by <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> and the apostles until in 1868 when I was cut from the church, and selected as a scapegoat to suffer for and bear the sins of my people.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">"As a duty to myself and mankind I now confess all that I did at Mountain Meadows massacre, without animosity to any one, shielding none, and giving the facts as they existed. <hi rend="italic">Those with me at that time were acting under orders from the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</hi>. The horrid deeds then committed were done as a duty which we believed we owed to God and our church. <seg type="Reaction" subtype="Silence">We were all sworn to secrecy before and after the massacre. The penalty for giving information concerning it was death.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">"As I am to suffer death for what I then did and have been betrayed by both those who gave orders and those who were the most active of my assistants, I now give the world the true facts as they exist, and tell why the massacre was committed, and who were the active participants.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS"><seg type="Blame" subtype="EmigrantBehavior">"I was told that there was not a drop of innocent blood in the whole company of emigrants, and was also referred to the gentile nation who refused the children of Israel passage through their country when Moses led them out of Egypt&#8212;that the Lord held that crime against them; and that when Israel was strong, the Lord commanded Joshua to slay the whole nation, men, women and children. 'Have not these people done worse than that to us? <seg type="Context" subtype="LDSPersecution">Have they not threatened to murder our leaders and prophets?

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">"They said that I was a good, liberal, free-hearted man, but too much of this sympathy would be always in the way; that every man now had to show his colors; that it was not safe to have a Judas in camp.

Major <persName key="Higbee, John M.">Higbee</persName> said: 'Brother <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> is right. Let him take an expression of the people.'

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">"At this moment I heard the screams of a child, looked up, and saw an Indian have a little boy by the hair of his head, dragging him out of the hind end of the wagon, with a knife in his hand, getting ready to cut his throat. I sprang for the Indian, with my revolver in hand, and shouted at the top of my voice, 'Arick, coma, cot too sooet,' (stop you fool). The child was terror stricken. His chin was bleeding. I supposed it was the cut of a knife, but after learned that it was done on the wagon-box, as the Indian yanked the boy down by the hair of the head.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">"I no sooner rescued this child than another Indian seized a little girlby the hair. I rescued her as soon as I could speak. I told the Indians they must not hurt the children&#8212;that I would die before they should be hurt; that we would buy the children from them. Before this time the Indians had rushed up around the wagons in quest of blood, and dispatched the wounded men.</seg> </seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">"I got up, saw the children, and among the others the boy who was pulled by the hair of the head out of the wagon by the Indian and saved by me. That boy I took home and kept until Dr. <persName key="Forney, Jacob">Forney</persName>, government agent, came to gather up the children and take them East. He took the boy with the others. The boy's name was <persName key="Fancher, Kit Carson (Charles)">Fancher</persName>. His father was captain of the train.

He replied that I could tell him more satisfactorily than he could write, and if I would stand up and shoulder as much of the responsibility as I could conveniently it would be a feather in my cap some day, and that I would get a celestial salvation, but the man that shrunk from it now would go to hell. I went and did as I was commanded.</seg></p>

<p>"<persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham</persName> asked me if <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Isaac C. Haight</persName> had sent a letter to him.

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">"Then I proceeded and gave him a full history of all, except that of my opposition. That I left out entirely. I told him of the killing of <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">the women and children</seg> and <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">the betraying of the company</seg>; that, I told him, I was opposed to, but I did not say to him to what extent I was opposed to it, only that I was opposed to shedding innocent blood.</seg></p>

<p>"I said, 'President <persName key="Young, Brigham">Young</persName>, you should either release these men from their obligation or sustain them when

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">Dr. <persName key="Nixon, O. W.">O. W. Nixon</persName> says: "Why this autobiography has never been seen by the public is easily understood. It was in the hands of the Mormons, and they had good reason for its suppression. When Judge <persName key="Boreman, Jacob S.">Boreman</persName> passed sentence on <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName>, under the statute law of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">the territory</placeName>, he gave the criminal the privilege of choosing between beheading, hanging, or being shot. <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> promptly decided to be shot. The judge then sentenced him to be shot on the 26th day of January, 1877, between the hours of to a. m. and 3 p. m. To enable an appeal to be taken to the Supreme Court, the date was, however, changed to March 23, 1877. The appeal failed to save him, and the day drew near. United States Marshal <persName key="Nelson, William">William Nelson</persName> conceived the justice of taking <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> to <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">the Mountain Meadow</geogName> for his execution. Justice <persName key="Boreman, Jacob S.">Boreman</persName> and the newspaper reporters supposed that the execution would take place in <placeName type="settlement" key="Beaver, UT">Beaver</placeName>, but the marshal and his criminal, with an armed guard were well on their way before the movement was know to the public. Having reached the scene, the marshal selected a spot for the execution about a hundred feet distant from <seg type="Reaction" subtype="Commemoration">the pile of rocks that marked the grave of <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">the murdered emigrants</seg></seg>. Seldom, if ever, was a criminal brought so face to face with his great crime. <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> was taken from the wagon and seated upon his coffin, and fronting the rock cairn, with five soldiers with needle guns standing forty feet distant. What realistic remembrances must have flocked to his mind amid such surroundings.

<pb n="58" xml:id="mmm.anti.fallows.1903.062"/>

Here was the very spot where he had brained <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">old men and helpless women</seg>! Just beyond, upon the hill, was where he had cut the throats of <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">two beautiful young girls just budding into womanhood</seg>, even while they "held his knees and prayed for their lives to be spared." Nineteen years and six months had passed since the horrible incident, but who will not believe that every event did not burn into his brain now, as righteous and retributive justice had finally reached for him. All was now ready, and at 10:30 o'clock his death sentence was read to him and he was given an opportunity to speak. He was attended by the Rev. Mr. <persName key="Stokes, George">Stokes</persName>, and to him he confessed, what he had not before acknowledged that "I killed <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">five of the emigrants</seg> with my own hands." He then menacingly said: "I have no favors to ask; I do not fear death. I shall never go to a worse place than this."</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">Hardened criminal as he was, it was easy to believe he had been experiencing in advance untold torture. He averred that "I am a firm believer in the gospel as taught in its purity by <persName key="Smith, Joseph">Joseph Smith</persName>," and then added, "I ask the Lord, my God, to extend his mercy to me and receive my spirit. My labors are done." The order from the marshal rang out: "Make ready, take aim, fire." The rifles spoke as one, and five bullets entered near the heart, and <persName key="Lee, John D.">John D. Lee</persName> was dead, without a struggle. Thus was the great crime at Mountain Meadow avenged by the strong arm of law, nineteen years and six months after the murdered victims had been consigned to their graves. While <persName key="Lee, John D.">John D. Lee</persName> was guilty and deserved his death, and had richly deserved it all the nineteen years and six

months, yet people who can weigh evidence will go on thinking, as Judge <persName key="Boreman, Jacob S.">Boreman</persName> said, in sentencing <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName>: "It seems to have been a vast conspiracy extending from <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName> to the bloody field. <seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">The emigrants were hounded all along the line, and nowhere were citizens allowed to sell them anything to sustain life.</seg> The men who actually participated in the deed are not the only guilty parties in the slaughter which occurred nineteen years ago."</seg></p>

<p>In the light of such facts, with a multitude of people yet living to testify to their truth, it would seem as if the people of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> were in immodest haste to canonize Bishop <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> among the "honored dead" in the rotunda of the National capitol, which <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">the state of Utah</placeName> has given notice she would do. Aside from all his teachings, which undermine all that is sacred in the American home, teachings and practices that would dishonor and dethrone virtue, this single act of his administration, <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">the crime <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Location">at <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">Mountain Meadows</geogName></seg>, should make this honor to his name and memory impossible.</seg> Virtuous womanhood and honest manhood should everywhere enter protest that legislators should heed and understand.</p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">Further Judge <persName key="Goodwin, C. C.">Goodwin</persName> says: "It is known that the murders were planned in <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>, that <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">many of the effects of the victims were carried to that city and sold</seg>.
