<p><hi rend="smallcaps">WE</hi> may here interrupt the narrative of events subsequent to the restoration of peace in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">the territory</placeName>, with the story of the most horrible massacre of <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">white people</seg> <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDSZealots">by religious fanatics</seg> of their own race that has been recorded since that famous St. Bartholemew's night in Paris&#8212; the story of the Mountain Meadows Massacre. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Dates">Committed on Friday, September 11, 1857, &#8212; four days before the date of <seg type="Context" subtype="UtahWar"><persName key="Young, Brigham">Young</persName>'s proclamation forbidding the United States troops to enter <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">the territory</placeName></seg> &#8212;</seg> it was a considerable time before more than vague rumors of the crime reached the Eastern states. <seg type="Reaction" subtype="StateInvestigation">No inquest or other investigation was held by Mormon authority</seg>, no person participating in the slaughter was arrested by a Mormon officer; and, <seg type="Reaction" subtype="FederalInvestigation"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Aftermath">when officers of the federal government first visited the scene, in the spring of 1859, all that remained to tell the tale were human skulls and other bones lying where the wolves and coyotes had left them, with scraps of clothing caught here and there upon the vines and bushes. Dr. <persName key="Brewer, Charles">Charles Brewer</persName>, the assistant army surgeon who was sent with a detail to bury the remains in May, 1859, says in his grewsome report:</seg></seg>&#8212;</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Aftermath">"I reached a ravine fifty yards from the road, in which I found portions of the skeletons of many bodies,&#8212;skulls, bones, and matted hair, &#8212; most of which, on examination, I concluded to be those of men. Three hundred and fifty yards further on another assembly of human remains was found, which, by all appearance, had been left to decay upon the surface; skulls and bones, most of which I believed to be those of women, some also of children, probably ranging from six to twelve years of age. Here, too, were found masses of women's hair, children's bonnets, such as are generally used upon the plains, and pieces of lace, muslin, calicoes, and other materials. Many of the skulls bore marks of violence, being pierced with bullet holes, or shattered by heavy blows, or cleft with some sharp-edged instrument."</seg><ref target="n0001">1</ref></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS"><seg type="Reaction" subtype="FederalInvestigation">More than seventeen years passed before officers of the United States succeeded in securing the needed evidence against any of the persons responsible for these wholesale murders, and a jury which would bring in a verdict of guilty.</seg> Then a single Mormon paid the penalty of his crime. He died asserting that he was the one victim surrendered by the Mormon church to appease the public demand for justice. The closest students of the Mountain Meadows Massacre and of <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName>'s rule will always give the most credence to this statement of <persName key="Lee, John D.">John D. Lee</persName>. Indeed, to acquit <persName key="Young, Brigham">Young</persName> of responsibility for this crime, it would be necessary to prove that the sermons and addresses in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of Discourses</hi> are forgeries.</seg></p>

Most of them seem to have been Methodists, and they had a preacher of that denomination with them. Prayers were held in camp every night and morning, and they never travelled on Sundays. They did not hurry on, as the gold-seekers were wont to do in those days, but made their trip one of pleasure, sparing themselves and their animals, and enjoying the beauties and novelties of the route.</seg><ref target="n0003">2</ref></p>

<note xml:id="n0002">1 <persName key="Stenhouse, T. B. H.">Stenhouse</persName> says that travelling the same route, and encamping near <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas">the Arkansans</seg>, was <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationMissouri">a company from <placeName type="state" key="Missouri">Missouri</placeName></seg> who called themselves "Missouri Wildcats," and who were so boisterous that <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas">the Arkansans</seg> were warned not to travel with them to <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>. <persName key="Whitney, Orson F.">Whitney</persName> says that the two parties travelled several days apart after leaving <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>. No mention of <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationMissouri">a separate company of Missourians</seg> appears in the official and court reports of the massacre.</note>

<note xml:id="n0003">2 <seg type="Blame" subtype="EmigrantBehavior"><persName key="Forney, Jacob">Jacob Forney</persName>, in his official report, says that he made the most careful inquiry regarding the conduct of the emigrants after they entered <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">the territory</placeName>, and could testify "that the company conducted themselves with propriety." In the years immediately following the massacre, <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">when the Mormons were trying to attribute the crime to Indians</seg>, <seg type="Encounter" subtype="Poison">much was said about the party having poisoned a spring and caused the death of Indians and their cattle. <persName key="Forney, Jacob">Forney</persName> found that one ox did die near their camp, but that its death was caused by a poisonous weed.</seg> Whitney, the church historian, who of course acquits the church of any responsibility for the massacre, draws a very black picture of the emigrants, saying, for instance, that at Cedar Creek "their customary proceeding of burning fences, whipping the heads off chickens, or shooting them in the streets or private door yards, to the extreme danger of the inhabitants, was continued. One of them, a blustering fellow riding a gray horse, flourished his pistol in the face of the wife of one of the citizens, all the time making insulting proposals and uttering profane threats."</seg>&#8212;"History of Utah," Vol. I, p. 696.</note>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="Route"><seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">When the company pitched camp on the river Jordan their food supplies were nearly exhausted, and their draught animals needed rest and a chance to recuperate. <seg type="Context" subtype="UtahWar">They knew nothing of the disturbed relations between the Mormons and the government when they set out, and they were astonished now to be told that they must break camp and move on southward. But they obeyed.</seg> At <placeName type="settlement" key="American Fork, UT">American Fork</placeName>, the next settlement, they offered some of their worn-out animals in exchange for fresh ones, and visited the town to buy provisions. There was but one answer&#8212;nothing to sell. Southward they continued, through <placeName type="settlement" key="Provo, UT">Provo</placeName>, <placeName type="settlement" key="Springville, UT">Springville</placeName>, <placeName type="settlement" key="Payson, UT">Payson</placeName>, <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Creek, UT">Salt Creek</placeName>, and <placeName type="settlement" key="Fillmore, UT">Fillmore</placeName>, at all settlements making the same effort to purchase the food of which they stood in need, and at all receiving the same reply.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeIndian">So much were their supplies now reduced that they hastened on until Corn Creek was reached; there they did obtain a little relief, some Indians selling them about thirty bushels of corn.</seg> But at <placeName type="settlement" key="Beaver, UT">Beaver</placeName>, a larger place, non-intercourse was again proclaimed, and at <placeName type="settlement" key="Parowan, UT">Parowan</placeName>, through which led the road built by the general government, they were forbidden to pass over this directly through the town, and the local mill would not even grind their own corn. <seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">At Cedar Creek, one of the largest southern settlements, they were allowed to buy fifty bushels of wheat, and to have it and their corn ground at <persName key="Lee, John D.">John D. Lee</persName>'s mill.</seg> After a day's delay they started on, but so worn out were their animals that it took them three days to reach Iron Creek, twenty miles beyond, and two more days to reach <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">Mountain Meadows</geogName>, fifteen miles farther south.</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Location">These "meadows" are a valley, 350 miles south of <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>, about five miles long by one wide. They are surrounded by mountains, and narrow at the lower end to a width of 400 yards, where a gap leads out to the desert. A large spring near this gap made that spot a natural resting-place, and there the emigrants pitched their camp.</seg> Had they been in any way suspicious of Indian treachery they would not have stopped there, because, from the elevations on either side, they were subject to rifle fire. Their anxiety, however, was not about the Indians, whom they had

found friendly, but about the problem of making the trip of seventy days to <placeName type="settlement" key="San Bernardino, CA">San Bernardino</placeName>, across a desert country, with their worn-out animals and their scant supplies. <seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">Had Mormon cruelty taken only the form of withholding provisions and forage from this company, its effect would have satisfied their most evil wishers.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Dates">On the morning of Monday, September 7</seg>, still unsuspicious of any form of danger, their camp was suddenly fired upon <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">by Indians</seg>, <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">(and probably by some white men disguised as Indians)</seg>. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">Seven of the emigrants were killed in this attack and sixteen were wounded.</seg> Unexpected as was this manifestation of hostility, the company was too well organized to be thrown into a panic. The fire was returned, and <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">one Indian was killed, and two chiefs fatally wounded.</seg> The wagons were corralled at once as a sort of fortification, and the wheels were chained together. In the centre of this corral a rifle pit was dug, large enough to hold all their people, and in this way they were protected from shots fired at them from either side of the valley. In this little fort they successfully defended themselves during that and the ensuing three days. <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="RescueAttempt"><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">Not doubting that Indians were their only assailants</seg>, two of their number succeeded in escaping from the camp on a mission to <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName> to ask for assistance. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">These messengers were met by three Mormons, who shot one of them dead, and wounded the other; the latter seems to have made his way back to the camp.</seg></seg></seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle"><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas">The Arkansans</seg> soon suffered for water, as the spring was a hundred yards distant.

The other undisguised Mormons remained in concealment, and <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">the Indians had been instructed to keep entirely out of sight.</seg> The beleaguered company were delighted to see a white man, and at once sent one of their number to meet him. Their ammunition was almost exhausted, <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">their dead were unburied in their midst</seg>, and their situation was desperate. <persName key="Bateman, William">Bateman</persName>, following out his instructions, told the representative of the emigrants that the Mormons had come to their assistance, and that, if they would place themselves in the white men's hands and follow directions, they would be conducted in safety to <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>, there to await a proper opportunity for proceeding on their journey.<ref target="n0007">1</ref> This plan was agreed to without any delay, and <persName key="Lee, John D.">John D.

No language can describe my feelings. My position was painful, trying, and awful; my brain seemed to be on fire; my nerves were for a moment unstrung; humanity was overpowering as I thought of</seg></seg>
