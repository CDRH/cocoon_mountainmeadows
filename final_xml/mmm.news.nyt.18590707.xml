<opener>Correspondence of the New-York Times,

<dateline> GREAT SALT LAKE CITY, Friday, June 10, 1859.</dateline></opener>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="TerritorialAdministration">The action of the Administration in regard to the conflict of authority between the Executive and Judicial Departments in this Territory, by which the conduct of Gov. <persName key="Cumming, Alfred">CUMMING</persName> has been fully sustained. has <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">greatly elated the Mormons.  The Bishops, Elders, &amp;c., who fled to the mountains to avoid arrest for the terrible crimes committed by them of late years, have returned to their homes, confident that they cannot be arrested without the intervention of the 
troops, the assistance of which is now practically denied to the United States Marshal and Judges.</seg></seg></p>

<p><orgName type="newspaper" key="Valley Tan">The Valley Tan</orgName>, which was established here as a <q>"Gentile"</q> paper, you may now consider as a Mormon organ, more dangerous to the truth than the <orgName type="newspaper" key="Desert News"><hi rend="italic">Deseret News</hi></orgName>, for the <hi rend="italic">News</hi> is openly Mormon, whilst the <orgName type="newspaper" key="Valley Tan">Valley Tan</orgName> pretends to be <q>"Gentile."</q>  You are aware of the change which has taken place in the publication of the paper. <persName key="Anderson, Kirk">KIRK ANDERSON</persName>, its late editor, has been compelled to retire from the editor's chair, because he did not support Gov. <persName key="Cumming, Alfred">CUMMING</persName> ; and Mr. <persName key="Hartnett, John">HARTNETT</persName>, Secretary of State for <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">the Territory</placeName>, a warm supporter of Gov. C., and the proprietor of the
press, has taken it in his own hands, and refuses to sell it to any one who will not support the <persName key="Cumming, Alfred">Governor</persName>.</p>

<p>During the last few days this City has worn the aspect of times past&#8212;of last year, at least.  Yesterday 
a large train of merchandise &#8212;thirty-eight mule-wagons&#8212;arrived for LIVINGSTON, KINKEAD &amp; Co.,
having spent the Winter on the plains.  This be the first train in from the East this  year, through several
had come in from <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName>.  Within the past  week numerous emigrants from <geogName type="mountain" key="Pike's Peak">Pike's Peak</geogName> have reached this place, and, after recruiting and exchanging  their stores and animals have passed on for <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName>.  They represent the <q>"Peak"</q> as the tallest humbug of America.</p>

<p>We may consider the present a season of arrivals. The last mail coach from the East brought as passenger
the Hon. <persName key="Bernhisel, J. M.">J. M. Bernhisel</persName>, Congressional Delegate from <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>.  By last evening's <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName> coach we had the person of Capt. <persName key="Cooper">COOPER</persName>, agent of Col. <persName key="Kinney">KINNEY</persName>, set down among us.  Whether he again comes to sell to the Prophet the fee simple  of the Mosquito Kingdom or not, we are not informed. Chief-Justice <persName key="Eckels Delana R.">ECKELS</persName>, and the newly appointed Indian agent, are soon expect in, as they were at <orgName type="military" key="Fort Kearney">Kearney</orgName> on the 15th ult.</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">Another of the Mountain Meadow children has been
recovered from the hands in which they have been held since the massacre of their parents.  Still another remains undiscovered, whose age is greater than that of any yet obtained.  <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">The Indians, who have heretofore been accused of that horrible murder</seg>, say they know the child, and will find her if she 
lives.  Of the sixteen already in Dr. <persName key="Forney, Jacob">FORNEY</persName>'S charge,  we have seen several, little boys from five to eight years of age.  All of these seem to have a recollection  of that bloody time, and to hear them lisp the story of their wrongs, with childish sorrow in their  countenances and voices, is enough to sadden one.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="ParrishMurder">The following petition has been addressed to Gov. 
<persName key="Cumming, Alfred">CUMMING</persName> by Mrs. PARISH:</seg></p>
  
<p><seg type="Context" subtype="ParrishMurder">DEAR SIR : I have heard that you have come here to execute the laws of the land; if so, I would like to have the murderers of my husband and son taken care of, for they intend to be gone before Court sits;&#8212;<persName key="McDonnel, A.

I had one span of horses stolen out of the stable at <placeName type="settlement" key="Springville, UT">Springville</placeName> and <persName key="Gee, Lysander">LYPANDER GEE</persName> has got my horses at <placeName type="settlement" key="Tooele, UT">Tooila</placeName>.

<p>The following is the petition of citizens of <placeName type="settlement" key="Springville, UT">Springville</placeName>, praying for the protection against Mormon outrages:</p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="WesternViolence">We the undersigned petitioners, would present that we are inhabitants of <placeName type="settlement" key="Springville, UT">Springville</placeName>, <placeName type="county" key="Utah County, UT">Utah County</placeName>, <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">U.T.</placeName> that we have been long been satisfied of the wile and corration of the Mormon theocracy.  The most of us are anxious to leave here and all are desirous to be relieved from Mormon tyranny and oppression.  The statute law, as practiced here is only a farce : the law is given by the   Mormon priesthood from time to time, as it suits our rules.  Our rights and privileges are taken away our citizens are seized and taken into private rooms or places, and there extraordinary confessions are extorted, and oaths administered that they will never at any time, or under any consideration go before any Court of the United States to give evidence against those in authority,  who have been guilty of the commission of crime.  Our property is driven off, and men, whose names are here up to aprended, have been dragged out in the night,  with bowie knives to their throats or pistols to their breasts; to seek redress would be certain death.  Our lives are threatened, and we have the most undoubted evidence that the secret council has passed sentence of death upon many of us, which we have only been able to elude by our own vigilance.  We are watched by a lawless, mmurderous police; our house are turned into sentry boxes, to our danger and annoyance&#8212;evils which increase with the lapse of time.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Reaction" subtype="MilitaryRetaliation">Our only hope at present is that you will detail a military
force, to be stationed here ; for, if not, <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">many of use must soon fall by the already blood stained hands of an unholy priesthood.</seg>  We would, therefore ask that if consistent with your instructions and authority, you will send us the military protection herein petitioned for. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</seg></p>

<head type="sub">MORMON OUTRAGES&#8212;RESULTS OF JUDGE
CRADLEBAUGH'S INVESTIGATIONS.</head>

<p><persName key="Anderson, Kirk">KIRK ANDERSON</persName> writes from <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName> to the <orgName type="newspaper" key="St. Louis Republican"><placeName type="settlement" key="St. Louis, MO">St. Louis</placeName> <hi rend="italic">Republican</hi></orgName>:</p>

<p><q>"Since the adjournment of Court at <placeName type="settlement" key="Provo, UT">Provo</placeName>, Judge
<seg type="Source" subtype="Cradlebaugh">CRADLEBAUGH has traveled South through his district as far as the Santa Clara</seg>&#8212;<seg type="Massacre" subtype="Location">a distance of near three hundred and fifty miles from here &#8212;visiting the scene of the Mountain Meadows</seg>, &amp;c.  He says that he did not see a bishop, bishop's counselor, or president on the route, although particular to inquire to them,  and reports that all have been <hi rend="italic">non est comatibus</hi>, except the Bishop of <placeName type="settlement" key="Spanish Fork, UT">Spanish Fork</placeName>, a Danish settlement some twelve miles south of Provo&#8212;this being the only  settlement, to his credit be it said, throughout his journey, in which he was not saluted with reports of horrid murders committed <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Dates">within the last two years</seg>. The Judge took affidavits, and issued warrants for about sixty of the offenders&#8212;forty in the massacre of the Mountain Meadows, ten in the murder of the <persName key="Aikens">AIKENS</persName> and others, making in all from eighty to one hundred persons that has issued for.  <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">He reported that more than eighty white men were engaged in the  massacre of the Mountain Meadows</seg> ; <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Aftermath">that after reaching Pariwan&#8212;eight miles this side of the <geogName type="waterway" key="Santa Clara River">Santa Clara</geogName>&#8212;at almost every camp the herders and soldiers gathering good, would come across skeletons, some indicating that they had been killed last Fall and  Winter by their condition.  To such an extent was this that the herders with the command that Judge <persName key="Cradlebaugh, John">C.</persName> accompanied could not be induced to keep the herds
out at night.</seg>  <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">No doubt teamsters and discharged
soldiers wending their way to <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName>, most of whom no doubt have been killed by the Indians, in pursuance of the example set them by their Mormon allies in the Mountain Meadows massacre, and who
they see act impertinently and with impunity in that matter.</seg></q></p>

<p>Atrocities too horrible to be related, and which seemed to shock the brute savages themselves are 
related by persons who claim to have been compelled  to join in that massacre.  <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">The number of persons in the train was about one hundred and fort </seg>: <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">seventeen
small children alone are saved</seg>.  <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">The property confiscated
amounting from $60,000 to $80,000, counting 700 cattle, horses and mules, some very fine stock, and
forty wagons and carriages.  The personal effects were taken to the tithing office in <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar city</placeName>, and there sold out.  Many of the clothes, stripped from the murdered persons, were piled in a room in the tithing office, and not selling readily on account of being filled with blood, were allowed to remain in 
that condition until the room has become so mush scented that it is very offensive to stay in.  <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">May it remain a stench in the nostrils of such saints for all time to come.</seg></seg></p>

<p>And here let me say, at a time when Judge <persName key="Cradlebaugh, John">CRADLEBAUGH</persName> has been using every exertion to expose these horrible transactions, <seg type="Source" subtype="WordofMouth">word has reached here that he
    has been removed</seg>, and <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">the Mormons are consequently rejoicing.  </seg><seg type="Reaction" subtype="MilitaryRetaliation">The last mail brought certain instructions to both Gov. <persName key="Cumming, Alfred">CUMMING</persName> and Gen. <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">JOHNSTON</persName>, the tenor of
which is to place the military, for civil purposes, entirely at the disposal of the Governor.  The effect of
this, in my judgment, will be to paralyze to a greater degree than ever any efforts upon the part of the
Judges here to execute the laws.</seg>"</p>
