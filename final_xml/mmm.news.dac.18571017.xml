<p><seg type="Source" subtype="WordofMouth">EDITORS ALTA: This morning, while conversing with some immigrants, who have lately arrived via the Plains from <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName>, and are living within a few miles of this place, I related to them the circumstances of the massacre.  <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">They immediately informed me that they knew who the parties were. They stated that there were <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas">three, and perhaps four, companies from Arkansas</seg>, while <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationMissouri">the balance of the company was made up of Missourians</seg>, who fell in with them; of these latter, they knew nothing, but <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas">the Arkansas companies, consisted of <orgName type="wagontrain" key="Fancher">Faziers</orgName>, <orgName type="wagontrain" key="Cameron">Camerons</orgName> and the two <orgName type="wagontrain" key="Dunlap">Dunlaps</orgName>, and perhaps <orgName type="wagontrain" key="Baker">Bakers</orgName>.

'Jack'">Baker</persName> had not arrived there when they left, but as they can learn nothing from him or his company, they concluded that he had fallen in and decided to come into California with these companies.
