<head>THE MORMON PRESS ON MOUNTAIN MEADOW.</head>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="LDSApostates">Whenever a Mormon falls from grace, which means a denial of the royal authority
of <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName>, that moment the recusant is cut off, rot and branch, as an
apostate for-ordained from the beginning to eternal perdition no less than mortal disgrace. To refuse to pay tubing into the coffers of ecclesmitical piracy is the unpardonable sin: far more so than to dispute the sangunary decrees of the Blood Atonement. Deploring the treasures of the Church by contumacy is not pouring in the annual tenth of a man's net profits, sends out the anathema of Zion; but when, occasionally, the dupe whose hands are gory in innocent blood shed by <q>"divine"</q> orders, repents his dreadful career by wholesome confession, then do all the curses of Danite theology find condemning speech to crush the penitent in his remorse, lest revelations of too worldly a character throw dangerous light on the dread secrets of Latter Dayism. Hence we find the <orgName type="newspaper" key="Salt Lake Herald">Salt Lake <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi></orgName>&#8212;the Janus-faced organ of the Church&#8212;in yesterday's issue making use of its choicest style of hypocrisy over the dispatch of Mr. <persName key="Simonton, J. W.">Simonton</persName>.  <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">The man <persName key="Klingensmith, Philip">Smith</persName>, who went into the slaughter at <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">Mountain Meadow</geogName>, was a priest of God, obedient to <q>"counsel"</q> when that crime of the century was perpetrated at the command of his then chief; but behold now how the sanctimonious elder attempts
to impeach the witness whose testimony comes up from the vale of murder! The <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> assumes a desire to bring <persName key="Klingensmith, Philip">Smith</persName> to <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, in order that his declaration may be put to the test of corroborative evidence, so that <q>"the Mormons, as a people,"</q> may not be charged with the crime.  This is shallow.  The Mormons, as a people, are not charged with that unparalleled massacre, but the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, as impersonated by <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName>, and his Apostles, did through them make the sacrifice of <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">more than one hundred and twenty human lives</seg>, showing no mercy to its victims.</seg>  The witnesses are hurrying in, of whom <persName key="Klingensmith, Philip">Smith</persName> is one, but, as many of these will soon appear; we shall now quote the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>â€™s comments which may be stereotyped for use in the cases of all others who are to follow, seeking amnesty from God and man, under the plea of <q>"Guilty."</q></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Source" subtype="Reprinted"><q>"<persName key="Simonton, J.W.">Simonton</persName>, chief of the associated press bureau in <placeName type="settlement" key="New York, NY">new York</placeName>, sends a telegram west over his own signature, <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">charging the Mormon people with the Mountain Meadow
massacre,</seg> on the alleged confession of one <persName key="Klingensmith, Philip">Smith</persName>, now in <placeName type="county" key="Lincoln County, NV">Lincoln county</placeName>, <placeName type="state" key="NV">Nevada</placeName>.
This <persName key="Klingensmith, Philip">Smith</persName>, by <persName key="Simonton, J.W.">Simonton</persName>'s showing, is either a murderer or a perjured scoundrel, and in either case is amenable to the laws.  He should be promptly arrested and brought to Utah on a requisition from Governor <persName key="Woods, George Lemuel">Woods</persName> to Governor <persName key="Bradley, Lewis R.">Bradley</persName>, and if his statements could be substantiated by any credible testimony the guilty should be punished. <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS"> But, the attempt made to charge the crime upon the Mormons, as a people, is an infamy only less in magnitude than the massacre itself.</seg> <seg type="Reaction" subtype="StateInvestigation">It has suited the malevolent policy of a few bitter anti-Mormons to refuse to avail themselves of every opportunity to fully investigate this matter, and continue to make general charges, which is seems to have at
met got a second <persName key="Hickman, BIll">Bill Hickman</persName> to make affidavit to."</seg></q></seg></p>
