<p><ref target="mmm.news.sfh.18571012b" type="related">In another column </ref> will be found the details of <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">the horrible slaughter by the Indians of <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">more than one hundred emigrants</seg>, <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Location">at a point three hundred miles this side of <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>.</seg> After reading them, the conclusion can hardly be resisted, that the <orgName type="religious" key="Church of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints">Mormons</orgName> have had something to do with this cruel butchery.</seg> <seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeIndian"><seg type="Blame" subtype="EmigrantBehavior">The statement that the Indians were impelled to fall upon the emigrants because they gave them money instead of goods for the things which they had purchased from them</seg>, and also that <seg type="Encounter" subtype="Poison">they placed poison in the body of an ox which had died, and also poisoned the pools,</seg> is not entitled to much weight, for, as the <orgName type="newspaper" key="Los Angeles Star">Star</orgName>&#8212;the paper from which we copy&#8212;very justly remarks, "it is hardly creditable that a party traveling along a highway would act in the manner described, and endanger the lives of those coming after them."</seg> We are <choice><sic>loth </sic><corr>loathe</corr></choice> to believe that the Mormons, as bad as they may be, could have instigated this massacre; <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">but when we reflect that there are grounds for believing that they had a hand in the murder of <persName key="Gunnison, John">Gunnison</persName> and his party&#8212;that there is in <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName> an organization of blood-thirsty scoundrels, known as the "<orgName type="religious" key="Danites">Destroying Angels</orgName>," who stop at no villainy, and <seg type="Context" subtype="PrattMurder">that <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas">the persons murdered were from the State in which the <persName key="Pratt, Parley Parker">Sainted Parley</persName> received the reward for his crimes</seg>, it is impossible to divert the mind from the suspicion that others besides the Indians had a hand in this horrible butchery.</seg></seg> <seg type="Source" subtype="Attributed_Christian">It will also be seen, that the <persName key="Christian, J.

All the facts relating to the subject, as far as known, are before them.</p>
