<p><seg type="Source" subtype="Reprinted">A correspondent of the <unclear /> Bulletin writing from <placeName type="settlement" key="Callville, AZ">Callville</placeName>, <placeName type="state" key="Arizona">Arizona</placeName>, under date of June 25th, says</seg> of the Indians in that vicinity:</p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="IndianRelationsUS">They are thoroughly posted in relation to the raids of Gen. <persName key="Connor, Patrick Edward">Connor</persName>'s command against the Indians farther North</seg>; the excitement existing in relation to the Mountain Meadow massacre; <seg type="Reaction" subtype="FederalInvestigation">the endeavors made by the Government to ferret out and punish the actors in this, the bloodiest drama ever perpetrated on American soil</seg>; <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">the fact that they are charged by the Mormons with being the sole perpetrators of that tragedy, and they fear that they will soon be held to a rigid accountability.</seg><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">It was to this valley of <geogName type="waterway" key="Muddy River">the Muddy</geogName>, that a large portion of the stock taken from the massacred train was brought</seg>, and <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">here was killed the only adult, a man by the name of <persName key="Williams">Williams</persName>, who escaped from <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">Mountain Meadows</geogName></seg></seg>. <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">These Indians do not hesitate to acknowledge their connection with the massacre, but charge the Mormons with being the instigators and chief actors in the tragedy</seg>.  The tales they tell are horrible beyond description, and while <seg type="Context" subtype="IndianRelationsLDS">it would be unjust, considering their present relations with the Mormons, to take all their statements for truth</seg>, <seg type="Context" subtype="PrattMurder">it is impossible to resist the conviction that revenge for the killing of <persName key="Pratt, Parley P.">Parley Pratt</persName>, in <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName>, was the inciting cause of the Mountain Meadow massacre, and that <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDSRetribution">a band of Danites were the directors of its perpetration</seg></seg>. I was astonished at the details by these Indians of circumstances and names; in the latter particular their statements were explicit, extending even to <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">giving us the name of the lady under whose charge the surviving children were taken East.</seg>  <seg type="Context" subtype="IndianRelationsLDS">The Mormons have long been noted for their shrewed management of Indians, but events now transpiring indicate that their influence with the savages is lessening.</seg>  The result may be the <seg type="Reaction" subtype="StateInvestigation">arrest and punishment</seg> of <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">the white miscreants who planned the indiscriminate slaughter</seg> of <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">men, women and children</seg> <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Location">at <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">Mountain Meadows</geogName></seg>.</p>
