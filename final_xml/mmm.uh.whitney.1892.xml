HOOPER DELEGATE TO CONGRESS&#8212;THE PONY EXPRESS&#8212;THE CIVIL WAR&#8212;CAMP FLOYD ABANDONED.</hi></hi></p>

<p>SOON after the arrival of the Federal officials who accompanied and immediately followed <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">Johnston</persName>'s army to <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, the three judges, <persName key="Eckels, David R.">David R. Eckels</persName>, <persName key="Sinclair, Charles E.">Charles E. Sinclair</persName>, and <persName key="Cradlebaugh, John">John Cradlebaugh</persName>, were assigned to their respective districts, and the machinery of the United States courts was set in motion. Chief Justice <persName key="Eckels, David R.">Eckels</persName>, preferring the military atmosphere to which for several months he had been accustomed, took up his residence at Camp Floyd; Associate Justice <persName key="Sinclair, Charles E.">Sinclair</persName> was assigned to the Third Judicial District, which, as now, embraced <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>, while Associate Justice <persName key="Cradlebaugh, John">Cradlebaugh</persName>, who was the last of the three to arrive, was appointed to the Second District, comprising the southern counties. The other officials were: <persName key="Hartnett, John">John Hartnett</persName>, Secretary; <persName key="Wilson, Alexander">Alexander Wilson</persName>, United States Attorney; <persName key="Dotson, Peter K.">Peter K. Dotson</persName>, Marshal, and <persName key="Forney, Jacob">Jacob Forney</persName>, Superintendent of Indian Affairs. It had been deemed proper by the authorities at <placeName type="state" key="Washington, D. C.">Washington</placeName> to separate the last-named office from that of Governor. All but one of the new officials were non-residents of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>. The exception was the United States Marshal, Mr. <persName key="Dotson, Peter K.">Dotson</persName>.</p>

<pb n="690" xml:id="mmm.uh.whitney.1892.690"/>

<p>Judge <persName key="Sinclair, Charles E.">Sinclair</persName> opened court at <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName> in November, 1858. His first move was not a reassuring one to the people, who, trusting in the pledge given by Governor Cumming and the Peace Commissioners, that the Federal representatives would keep faith with the citizens and hold sacred the amnesty extended by President Buchanan, had abandoned their exodus and returned to their homes and various avocations. It seemed to them an attempt to ignore or override the President's decree; to render null and void his offer of pardon which the people had accepted. In short, Judge <persName key="Sinclair, Charles E.">Sinclair</persName>, in charging the grand jury of his court, urged them to indict ex-Governor Young, Lieutenant-General Wells and other prominent Mormons for treason; also for intimidation of court and for, polygamy. The Judge held that President Buchanan's pardon,' while it was "a public fact in the history of the country," "ought to be brought judicially by plea, motion or otherwise." This meant that the decree of the Chief Magistrate of the nation was not to have full force and effect until he, <persName key="Sinclair, Charles E.">Charles E. Sinclair</persName>, appointed by said Chief Magistrate an Associate Justice of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, had sat upon it and pronounced it valid; or, as Mr. Stenhouse puts it, "he wanted to bring before his court <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> and the leading Mormons to make them admit that they had been guilty of treason, and make them humbly accept from him the President's clemency."<ref target="n01">*</ref></p>

<p>The vain-glorious attempt failed, as it deserved to do. A sensible man, one not so anxious to re-open the wound then healing, to renew the strife which had just been brought to a close, was the United States Attorney, <persName key="Wilson, Alexander">Alexander Wilson</persName>. He refused to present to the jury bills for indictments for treason, on the ground that the President's pardon had been presented by the Peace Commissioners and accepted by the people, whereupon peace had been proclaimed by the Governor of the Territory. An indictment was secured against <persName key="Ferguson, James">James Ferguson</persName> for intimidation of court, the act of which occurred in Judge Stiles' district at <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName> in 1854, and grew

out of the rivalry existing between the Federal and Territorial officers and tribunals referred to in a former chapter. The case against Mr. Ferguson never came to judgment. As to polygamy, there being no law against the practice,&#8212;for it was not until 1862 that Congress legislated against polygamy as "bigamy,"&#8212;the grand jury failed to return any indictments on that score.</p>

<p>The only other act of Judge <persName key="Sinclair, Charles E.">Sinclair</persName>'s that causes his name to be remembered in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>&#8212;barring his collusion with other officials to secure the arrest of <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> on a trumped-up, baseless charge of counterfeiting&#8212;was his sentencing a man who had committed murder to be executed on the Sabbath. This man was Thomas H. Ferguson, a non-Mormon, who, while drunk, had shot and killed his employer, Alexander Carpenter, another non-Mormon. The homicide occurred September 17th, 1859, and the execution&#8212;the day originally set having been changed&#8212;on Friday, the 28th of October.<ref target="n02">*</ref> Judge <persName key="Sinclair, Charles E.">Sinclair</persName> was quite a young man, which may partly account for some of his idiosyncrasies.</p>

<p>Meantime Judge <persName key="Cradlebaugh, John">Cradlebaugh</persName> had begun operations in the Second Judicial District. This court convened at Provo on the 8th of March, 1859. The seat of the Second District was at Fillmore, the former capital of the Territory, and it was there, on the first Monday of November, 1858, that Judge <persName key="Cradlebaugh, John">Cradlebaugh</persName> should have opened court. Such was the appointment made for him before his arrival by Judges Eckels and <persName key="Sinclair, Charles E.">Sinclair</persName>, constituting a majority of the supreme bench of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, empowered by Congress to arrange those matters. The appointment was made in August, 1858, but Judge <persName key="Cradlebaugh, John">Cradlebaugh</persName> did not arrive upon the scene of his labors until the first week in November. This was probably his reason for not

<note xml:id="n02">* Said the condemned man on the scaffold: "I was tried by the statutes of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah Territory</placeName>, which give a man the privilege of being shot, beheaded or hanged. But was it given to me? No, it was not. All Judge <persName key="Sinclair, Charles E.">Sinclair</persName> wanted was to sentence some one to be hanged, then he was willing to leave the Territory; and he had too much whiskey in his head to know the day he sentenced me to be executed on, and would not have known, if it had not been for the people of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> laughing at him. It would have been on Sunday. A nice Judge to send to any country!"</note>

beginning on time; but why he did not open court at the place appointed, but arbitrarily changed it from <placeName type="settlement" key="Fillmore, UT">Fillmore</placeName> to <placeName type="settlement" key="Provo, UT">Provo</placeName>, in the absence of an avowed reason must be surmised. We surmise, therefore, that it was in order to be nearer Camp Floyd; it being the design of Judge <persName key="Cradlebaugh, John">Cradlebaugh</persName>, in inaugurating the extraordinary proceedings by him contemplated, to call to his aid the strong arm of the military. That design, as we shall see, was strictly carried out.</p>

<p>Judge <persName key="Cradlebaugh, John">Cradlebaugh</persName> proposed to investigate, among other things, the Mountain Meadows massacre, referred to previously. The facts relating to this terrible tragedy, as gathered from the most reliable sources,&#8212;some of which have never before been drawn upon,&#8212;will now be laid before the reader.</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Dates">The summer of 1857 </seg>furnished the bloodiest page in all the history of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>. The theme is approached by the chronicler with shuddering, and its recital must fill the heart of every reader with horror. There is a crime that is worse than murder&#8212;a massacre; and massacre never assumes form so horrid as when <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">its victims are defenseless</seg>,&#8212;most dreadful of all when with the slain mingles the blood of <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">helpless women and innocent children</seg>.</p>

<p>About midsummer of the year mentioned a large body of <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationMissouri"><placeName type="state" key="Missouri">Missouri</placeName></seg> and <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas"><placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName> emigrants</seg>, <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="Route">en route to <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName></seg>, reached <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>. <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">They traveled in two separate parties, and were <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">well provided with stock, implements and the supplies constituting the usual emigrant outfit</seg>.</seg> <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="Route">For some days after their arrival, during which time they had repairs made in their vehicles and had their animals shod, they were in doubt as to which route of the two then commonly used to the Coast they should follow. At length <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas">the <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName> party</seg> decided, probably upon the advice of General <persName key="Rich, Charles C.">Charles C. Rich</persName> who was familiar with both, to take the northern route, which, it will be remembered, crossed Bear River and proceeded along the Humboldt. They started, but made only a few days' journey,&#8212;it was afterwards learned that they went no farther than Bear River&#8212;when for some reason, probably because southern <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName> was their destination, the majority concluded to return

<pb n="693" xml:id="mmm.uh.whitney.1892.693"/>

and take the southern route, leading through southwestern <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>. Proceeding southward through the <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> settlements, the two companies, one of which, <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas">the Arkansas party</seg>, was led by a man named <persName key="Fancher, Alexander">Fancher</persName>, and the other, <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationMissouri">the <placeName type="state" key="Missouri">Missouri</placeName> party</seg>, was under command of a Mr. <persName key="Dukes, William C.">Dukes</persName>, became separated by several days' journey. It is known that <persName key="Dukes, William C.">Dukes</persName>' company were delayed some time near <placeName type="settlement" key="Beaver, UT">Beaver</placeName>. Here they had trouble with the Indians, one of whom they had shot. Being attacked, they corralled their wagons and sought protection in a rifle pit. Two of them were wounded, but the Indians were soon placated through the intervention of officers of the <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> militia, who distributed to them liberal contributions of beef. <persName key="Fancher, Alexander">Fancher</persName>'s party in the meantime kept moving ahead, and had penetrated the Indian country and were beyond the line of settlements before <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationMissouri">the Missouri company</seg> advanced from this camp.</seg></p>

<p>It was a time of great anxiety if not of intense excitement in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>. <seg type="Context" subtype="UtahWar">News had just come that the troops sent by President <persName key="Buchanan, James">Buchanan</persName> were nearing <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">the Territory</placeName>, and every express brought reports of the brutal and infamous threats with which the camps of the soldiery resounded. In their wagons, they declared, were the ropes with which the Mormon leaders were to be hanged. <seg type="Context" subtype="LDSPersecution">With their recent experiences in <placeName type="state" key="Missouri">Missouri</placeName> and <placeName type="state" key="Illinois">Illinois</placeName> fresh in their minds, the settlers were naturally in a state of the utmost anxiety as to the developments of the future.</seg> Martial law was all but declared in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, and the people were fully warned as to the exceeding gravity of the situation. Under the circumstances it was their plain duty to watch for signs of hostility on the part of emigrants or others who sought to pass through <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">the Territory</placeName>.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="EmigrantBehavior">Whatever may have been the conduct of these companies when they encountered the <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> outposts on the east, there seems to be no question that not long after their arrival in Salt Lake Valley they gave abundant evidence of their hostility and vindictiveness. During their entire journey through <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">the Territory</placeName> they appear to have conducted themselves in the most offensive manner. They swaggered through the towns, declaring their intention, as soon

<pb n="694" xml:id="mmm.uh.whitney.1892.694"/>

as they should have conveyed their women and children to a place of safety, to return with military force sufficient to complete such destruction of the Mormons as the United States soldiery might leave unfinished. <seg type="Context" subtype="LDSPersecution">They averred that the murdered leaders of the Church had received but tardily their deserts, and gave the impression, if they did not positively boast, that in their company were hands that had been reddened with the Prophet's blood.</seg> Nor were their offenses confined to harrowing and insulting words. They acted like a band of marauders, preying upon the possessions of those whose country they traversed, and committing all manner of petty indignities upon person and property. Still graver crimes were charged against them by the Indians. They were said not only to have wantonly shot some of the braves, but were known to have <seg type="Encounter" subtype="Poison">left poisoned beef where the savages would be likely to get it. Several deaths, attributed to this cause, occurred among the Indians near <placeName type="settlement" key="Fillmore, UT">Fillmore</placeName>, and numbers of their animals perished through drinking water from springs poisoned by the emigrants when about to break camp</seg>.</seg></p>

<p>One result of this deliberate policy of exasperation was the attack by Indians on the rear party, the <placeName type="state" key="Missouri">Missouri</placeName> contingent, at its camp near <placeName type="settlement" key="Beaver, UT">Beaver</placeName>. Dissuaded at that time from their design to take summary revenge for the atrocities committed against them, the Indians hung on the horizon of their foe, as the latter drove out past the last settlements, and when in the very heart of the Indian country the attack was renewed. Again the services of the Mormons, two or three of whom had been detailed to overtake and accompany the emigrants as guides and interpreters, stood the besieged in good stead. The enraged savages were bought off with the loose stock of the company, agreeing to leave unmolested the teams and wagons and take no life. These emigrants resumed their journey and reached their destination in safety.<ref target="n03">*</ref>

<note xml:id="n03">* Soon afterwards the Indians were persuaded by the president of the Southern <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> Indian mission&#8212;<persName key="Hamblin, Jacob">Jacob Hamblin</persName>&#8212;to surrender the stock, and all that had not been killed was delivered by him to an agent who came to receive it in response to his notification that it was held subject to his order.</note>

<pb n="695" xml:id="mmm.uh.whitney.1892.695"/>

For the leading party, however, a horrible fate was reserved. Though in the main composed of families that bore the appearance of respectability, <seg type="Blame" subtype="MissouriWildCats">there was a rough and lawless element in their ranks that lost no opportunity of exhibiting its bitterness and destructiveness.</seg> <seg type="Encounter" subtype="Poison">Against this company, as stated, was laid the fearful charge of injecting poison into the carcass of one of their oxen,<ref target="n04">*</ref> first having learned that the Indians would be likely to eat the meat, and of throwing packages of poison into the springs. In other ways they contrived to render themselves obnoxious to the settlers and hateful to the natives.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="PrattMurder"><seg type="Blame" subtype="EmigrantBehavior">It is hinted, too, that coming from the state and some even from the county in which one of the Apostles, <persName key="Pratt, Parley P.">Parley P. Pratt</persName>, had been assassinated only a short time before, the blood-thirsty talk of the emigrants had intensified the feeling their other conduct had aroused among the people.</seg> In the spring of this same year Apostle <persName key="Pratt, Parley P.">Pratt</persName> had stood trial in <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName> on the charge of having married the wife and abducted the children of <persName key="McLean, Hector">Hector McLean</persName>, a Louisianian by birth but then a resident of <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName>. The charge was not sustained, and the defendant was acquitted. But <persName key="McLean, Hector">McLean</persName>'s threat of vengeance and the solicitation of friends impelled the Apostle to seek safety in flight. Undertaking to make his way alone on horseback through a wild and sparsely settled country, he was intercepted by accomplices of <persName key="McLean, Hector">McLean</persName> and held until the latter could come up and dispatch him. The assassin in his fury not only plunged his knife repeatedly into the body of his victim, but also shot him through the breast with a pistol snatched from the hand of a comrade. Neither principal nor accomplices in the tragedy were ever brought to justice, though the testimony at the coroner's inquest substantiated the facts here narrated.</seg> <ref target="n05">&#8224;</ref></p>

was universally believed to be impending. It was accordingly the custom for the more prominent citizens to meet together frequently to discuss the situation and exchange ideas and suggestions as to what course should be taken with reference to any emergency. In their scattered condition,&#8212;many of them living on farms and ranches several miles distant,&#8212;it was no easy task to secure attendance at such a meeting except by previous appointment. Thus it happened that Sunday, when the people were accustomed to assemble for religious worship, came to be chosen for these brief consultations, the men folks meeting in council before the usual services began, or remaining a short time after they were concluded. Such was the case on Sunday, the 30th of August, the second or third day after the <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName> company had passed through. The conduct of that company in and near <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar</placeName>, and the knowledge of their lawlessness all along the line of previous settlements, associated with the ferocious threat that their early return as a mob of destroyers might be expected, caused earnest and even indignant allusion to them at this particular council. <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">By some it was suggested that as they were about to enter the Indian country the savages would be likely to harass and plunder them to a degree that would prevent their promised return.</seg> It is probable that others were in favor of bringing them back and holding them as prisoners of war. What other suggestions, if any, were offered at the time is not known; but it is a fact that it was then and there resolved that the Indians should be held in check, and the emigrants permitted to pass in safety. A dispatch to that effect was sent shortly afterward by Lieutenant-Colonel <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> to the presiding official at Pinto [or Painter] Creek.</p>

often asserted&#8212;but <seg type="Context" subtype="IndianRelationsLDS">acting at this time as farmer among the Indians, and doubtless possessing much influence with them</seg>. His response indicated that he was displeased with the peaceful decision of the council. But though the Indians were gathered in force and under much excitement, near Pinto, the emigrants pursued their way in safety past that point and went into camp at the south end of <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">Mountain Meadows</geogName>, about forty miles from <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar</placeName>. These elevated pastures were almost on the water-shed, or "rim of the Basin;" and as they proved to be a pleasant, grassy spot, the emigrants planned to remain there and recuperate before venturing upon the desert. They had been unable to purchase wagon grease at the settlements&#8212;the settlers had none for themselves&#8212;and after reaching camp, which was probably about Thursday, September 3rd, they sent two men into the pines to make tar to be used as a substitute.<ref target="n06">*</ref></p>

<p>In the meantime two men were despatched from <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar</placeName> under military orders to visit the camp at <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">the Meadows</geogName> and ascertain if possible what the real program and intentions of the party were. About the same time there was a general movement looking to a concentration of the Indians, though they do not seem to have massed at one point in any considerable number until Sunday, the 6th. The two messengers proceeded to <persName key="Hamblin, Jacob">Hamblin</persName>'s ranch, in the north end of <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">the Meadows</geogName>, from which place they twice visited the emigrants, on Saturday, the 5th, and Sunday, the 6th.

From that time on, Indian and white runners came almost daily from the scene of strife.

Indians bent on bloodshed, and outnumbering ten to one their own forces. An attempt by the militia to assist the emigrants would have transferred to themselves the Indian attack. During that day and the next, awaiting further orders they lay in camp, near to but out of sight of the entrenched emigrants, who were on the other side of a small hill. Thursday brought slight reinforcements, but by this time more Indians had arrived upon the scene. The whites, who were from the Santa Clara country, believed, as did <persName key="Higbee, John M.">Higbee</persName>'s men, that they were summoned there on an errand of mercy, to bury the dead and protect the survivers. But the fury of the Indians was uncontrollable. <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> may have attempted, as he says, to restrain them. It is not improbable, however, that after some of the Indians had been wounded, and himself had had a narrow escape from the riflemen in the corral, he made no further attempt to check the assault. He exhibited bullet holes in his clothing and hat, where <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas"><placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName> marksmanship</seg> had given evidence of its accuracy. But the Indians for some reason were inclined to think that he and the white men were planning to cheat them of their prey. About the third day of the attack, two men from <persName key="Hamblin, Jacob">Hamblin</persName>'s ranch approached the scene of battle, and came upon some wounded savages. Companions of the latter at once surrounded the two, upbraiding them with <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName>'s supposed desertion of the Indians' cause, and compelling them, probably in order to demonstrate whether a friendly understanding existed between the whites on both sides, to run the gauntlet of the emigrant fire. They were required to pass in full view and close range of the camp, down the hill, across the valley and up on the other side. To make the attempt seemed to court certain death, but to refuse the Indians was to invite the vengeance of a still more savage foe. They made the daring run and escaped unharmed, though bullets whistled past them thick and fast.</seg></seg><ref target="n08">*</ref></p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="WesternViolence">I will say to you, Gentlemen of the Grand Jury, that from what I learn, it has been some time since a court, having judicial cognizance in your district, was held.

<p>They have provided the Probate Courts with criminal jurisdiction, and it would seem that the whole machinery was made so that they should be brought before that court and tried, and the fact that there is no additional legislation to provide for bringing them before this court, proves that it was done to prevent.</p>

<p>The Judge then proceeded to find fault with the Deseret News for indulging in certain strictures on the Federal courts, and with ex-Governor <persName key="Young, Brigham">Young</persName> for an alleged similar cause.

<p>While Judge <persName key="Cradlebaugh, John">Cradlebaugh</persName> was delivering his charge to the grand jury, a detachment of infantry from Camp Floyd, numbering about a hundred men, commanded by Captain Heth, entered and encamped without permission upon the grounds adjoining the building&#8212;the Provo Seminary&#8212;which was being used temporarily as a court house. These grounds, with the Seminary, belonged to the city. While the soldiers invested the outside premises, the officers took up their quarters in the lower part of the building. Amazed and alarmed at this high-handed proceeding, which was looked upon as an attempt to intimidate jurors, witnesses and other persons attending court, the citizens of Provo at once filed indignant protests against the presence of the troops, and petitioned the Mayor and City Council to order their removal. Thereupon the Mayor, B. K. Bullock, in behalf of the council, addressed a memorial to Judge <persName key="Cradlebaugh, John">Cradlebaugh</persName> setting forth the facts stated and respectfully praying him to cause the military force to be removed beyond the limits of the municipality.</p>

<p>To this memorial the Judge replied that the temporary location of the troops in the city was a movement well considered before it was determined upon; that they were there at his request, having been "kindly furnished" by the commanding general at Camp Floyd, and that their presence was a matter of necessity, to secure prisoners who were to be tried before the court; there being no jail in which to confine them. His Honor stated in the course of his communication that the soldiers were as quiet and orderly a set of men as he ever saw. " As to your remark about intimidation," said the Judge to the Mayor, "allow me to say that good American citizens have no cause to fear American troops."</p>

<p>Mayor Bullock and the City Council immediately rejoined, informing Judge <persName key="Cradlebaugh, John">Cradlebaugh</persName> that he was mistaken in asserting that there was no jail in Provo; that they had a place prepared for such purposes, and were both willing and able, as were the authorities of the County, to provide abundantly for the security and necessities of all prisoners. They also informed him that

<pb n="712" xml:id="mmm.uh.whitney.1892.713"/>

through the drunkenness and supercilious conduct of some of his "quiet and orderly soldiers" several unpleasant circumstances had already occurred between them and the citizens. Against the needless and degrading use of the army as "a walking calaboose" and the superseding of the civil by the military power, the city authorities again protested, and renewed their request for the removal of the troops. All <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> County was now aroused and petitions and protests of a similar character began pouring in from every side. Judge <persName key="Cradlebaugh, John">Cradlebaugh</persName> paid no attention to them whatever, but kept the court house surrounded by soldiers while he awaited the desired action . of the grand jury, to wit: the indictment of the Mormon leaders for the crimes referred to in his extraordinary address. More troops soon appeared upon the scene. Eight companies of infantry, one of artillery and one of cavalry, under Major Paul, followed Heth's command from Camp Floyd, and were stationed within sight of the Provo court house.</p>

<p>Public excitement and indignation increased correspondingly, and the citizens of Provo, and not only they, but the people of the Territory at large, now appealed to Governor Cumming against this flagrant infringement of their liberties. That appeal was not in vain. The Governor, not being in sympathy with the course pursued by the Federal Judges, and recognizing the rightfulness of the people's cause, promptly requested General <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">Johnston</persName> to order the troops removed. The General, however, who was not only in sympathy, but in collusion with the Judges, refused to comply, holding himself obligated by the instructions of the War Department to his predecessor, General Harney, to obey the summons, not only of the Governor but of the Judges, and even of the United States Marshal, for troops to aid them in the performance of their duties. In this view General <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">Johnston</persName> was of course sustained by the Judges. Doubtless his antipathy to Governor Cumming had something to do with his refusal to honor the request. But the Governor, who was quite a positive character, and knew his own rights as well as those

<pb n="713" xml:id="mmm.uh.whitney.1892.714"/>

of the people, did not propose to be trifled with. He forthwith issued the following proclamation :</p>

<p>Whereas, one company of the U. S. Infantry, under the command of Captain Heth, is now stationed around the Court House at Provo, where the Hon. John Cradlebaugh is now holding court, and eight additional companies of infantry, one of artillery, and one of cavalry, under the command of Major Paul, are stationed within sight of the Court House ; and,
Whereas, the presence of soldiers has a tendency, not only to terrify the inhabitants and disturb the peace of the Territory, but also to subvert the ends of justice, by causing the intimidation of witnesses and jurors; and,</p>

<p>Whereas, this movement of troops has been made without consultation with me, and, as I believe, is in opposition to both the letter and spirit of my instructions; and,</p>

<p>Whereas, Gen'l. <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">Johnston</persName>, commander of the military department of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, has refused my request that he would issue the necessary orders for the removal of the above mentioned troops :</p>

<p>Now, therefore, I ALFRED CUMMING, Governor of the Territory of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, do hereby publish this my solemn protest against this present military movement, and also against all movements of troops incompatible with the letter and spirit of the annexed extract from the instructions received by me from government for my guidance while Governor of the Territory of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>.</p>

<p>In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the

<p>It is your duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, and to maintain the peace and good order of the Territory, and also to support by your power and authority the civil officers in the performance of their duties.

<p>About the same time Judges <persName key="Sinclair, Charles E.">Sinclair</persName> and <persName key="Cradlebaugh, John">Cradlebaugh</persName>&#8212;Judge Eckels seems to have been absent from the scene&#8212;addressed a joint letter to the United States Attorney-General in relation to the matter at issue. To the answer of that high functionary, which fully sustained Governor Cumming, and figuratively cuffed the ears of his opponents, reference will be made a little later.</p>

<p>Judge <persName key="Cradlebaugh, John">Cradlebaugh</persName>, without waiting for the grand jury to present the indictments that he desired, and doubtless despairing of their intention so to do, began issuing bench warrants for the apprehension of certain persons suspected of complicity in the Springville murders. These warrants were served by the U. S. Marshal, accompanied by a squad of soldiers. Several men were arrested, among them some Mormon witnesses subpoenaed by the grand jury, and handed over to the keeping of the military. There were also a number of Indians and a few Gentiles in custody.</p>

<p>After waiting in vain two weeks for the grand jury to gratify him, Judge <persName key="Cradlebaugh, John">Cradlebaugh</persName> became angry, and summoning the members of that body before him, he discharged them, at the same time dismissing the prisoners then in custody and closing his court. He entered upon the docket these words: "The whole community presents a united and organized opposition to the administration of justice." In his final address to the grand jury, His Honor wrathfully said:</p>

<p>If it is expected that this court is to be used by this community as a means of protecting it against the pecadillos of Gentiles and Indians; unless this community will punish its own murderers, such expectation will not be realized. It will be used for no such purpose.</p>

<p>When this people come to their reason and manifest a disposition to punish their own high offenders, it will then be time to enforce the law also for their protection. If this court cannot bring you to a proper sense of your duty, it can at least turn the savages in custody loose upon you.</p>

<p>In summing up the evidence in the Springville cases, the Judge had thus expressed himself:</p>

<p>Men are murdered here.	Coolly, deliberately, premeditatedly murdered&#8212;their
murder is deliberated and determined upon by Church council meetings and that, too, for

<pb n="715" xml:id="mmm.uh.whitney.1892.716"/>

no other reason than that they had apostatized from your Church and were striving to leave the Territory. You are the tools, the dupes, the instruments of a tyrannical Church despotism. The heads of your Church order and direct you. You are taught to obey their orders and commit these horrid murders. Deprived of your liberty, you have lost your manhood, and become the willing instruments of bad men.</p>

<p>The grand jury framed a reply, remonstrating against these insults and protesting against their untimely and dishonorable discharge. They stated that they were surrounded during their deliberations by a detachment of the army, and that army officers were quartered within hearing of the evidence of witnesses who were being examined in the jury-room; that they presented indictments for offenses against the laws of the United States, which indictments had been treated with contempt and the prisoners indicted liberated without trial; that witnesses subpoenaed by the grand jury had been treacherously arrested and the jury deprived of their evidence; but that notwithstanding they were thus trammeled by the court, they had honored their oath and were endeavoring to faithfully discharge their duties when they were dismissed by His Honor with a slanderous and insulting harangue.<ref target="n16">*</ref></p>

<p>Soon after the closing of the court, the troops investing Provo were withdrawn. And so ended Judge <persName key="Cradlebaugh, John">Cradlebaugh</persName>'s vain attempt&#8212;could it be otherwise than vain ?—to saddle upon the Mormon Church, upon an entire community, crimes committed by a few individuals, for whose conduct that Church, that community, could not justly or reasonably be held responsible.</p>

<p>But the game was not yet played out. Another act of the drama remained; an act that came very near provoking a serious conflict, with General <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">Johnston</persName> and the troops at Camp Floyd on one side, and Governor Cumming and the <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> militia on the other.

A conspiracy had been concocted by the Federal officials for the arrest of <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> on a charge of counterfeiting,&#8212;the trumped-up case mentioned previously. This attempt was made about the time that the troops were withdrawn from Provo. A young artist, an engraver, residing at <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>, had been employed by certain parties from Camp Floyd to duplicate a plate used by the Quarter-master of that post for notes drawn upon the assistant treasurers of the United States at St. Louis and New York. The artist, who was very clever, did his work well, but it is believed was not aware that he was committing a criminal act. This, however, did not suffice to shield him. The fraud being discovered, the principal, one Brewer, who had employed the engraver to make the plate, was arrested at Camp Floyd. He immediately turned states evidence, shifting the onus from his own shoulders to those of the artist, and also endeavoring to implicate President <persName key="Young, Brigham">Young</persName> in the affair. The charge against the latter was absolutely groundless, but it suited the purpose of the conspirators, and was simply another attempt to make " some person high in authority" responsible for the misdeed of a comparatively obscure individual. A writ was issued for the arrest of the artist, and another for the apprehension of <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName>. The U. S. Marshal was to serve the writs, and if resisted, as it was fully expected he would be, General <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">Johnston</persName>'s artillery was to make a breach in the wall surrounding the residence of the ex-Governor, who would be taken by force and carried to Camp Floyd.</p>

<p>Such was the program which certain officers from camp, entrusted with the service of the writs, laid before Governor Cumming, soliciting his co-operation in the matter. To the artist's apprehension, His Excellency offered no objection; in fact he helped to secure it; but to the arrest of <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> on such a baseless charge he would not listen. Said the Governor to the officers: "When you have a right to take <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName>, gentle-men, you shall have him without creeping through walls, you shall enter by his door with heads erect, as becomes representatives of

<pb n="717" xml:id="mmm.uh.whitney.1892.718"/>

your government. But till that time, gentlemen, you can't touch <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> while I live, by G&#8212;d."</p>

<p>Discomfited, the officers returned to Camp Floyd. It was now rumored that General <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">Johnston</persName> would send two regiments and a battery of artillery to enforce the writ for the arrest of the Mormon leader. Governor Cumming promptly informed General Wells of this report, and directed him to hold the militia in readiness to repel the threatened assault. Five thousand men flew to arms in response to this order, and eagerly awaited the issue. But the regiments from Camp Floyd did not come. General <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">Johnston</persName> had evidently changed his mind. Soon afterward the letter from the United States Attorney-General, in answer to Judges <persName key="Sinclair, Charles E.">Sinclair</persName> and <persName key="Cradlebaugh, John">Cradlebaugh</persName> came to hand. That letter decided that the troops could be used as a posse to enforce the processes of the courts only upon the call of the Governor. The power of the judicial-military conspirators was thus broken. A few extracts from this letter of Judge Black's, which was dated May 17th, 1859, are here inserted. Said the great jurist to the <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> judges:</p>

<p>The condition of things in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> made it extremely desirable that the judges appointed for that Territory should confine themselves strictly within their own official sphere. The Government had a district attorney, who was charged with the duties of a public accuser, and a marshal, who was responsible for the arrest and safe-keeping of criminals. For the judges there was nothing left except to hear patiently the cases brought before them, and to determine them impartially according to the evidence adduced on both sides.	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*</p>

<p>The Governor is the supreme Executive of the Territory. He is responsible for the public peace. From the general law of the land, the nature of his office, and the instructions he received from the State department, it ought to have been understood that he alone had power to issue a requisition for the movement of troops from one part of the Territory to another,&#8212;that he alone could put the military forces of the Union and the people of the Territory into relations of general hostility with one another. The instructions given to the Commanding-General by the War Department are to the same effect. In that paper a "<hi rend="italic">requisition</hi>" is not spoken of as a thing which anybody except the Governor can make. It is true that in one clause the General is told that if the Governor, judges, or the marshal shall find it necessary to <hi rend="italic">summon directly</hi> a part of the troops to aid either in the performance of his duty, he (the General) is to see the <hi rend="italic">summons</hi> promptly obeyed. This was manifestly intended to furnish the means of repelling an opposition which might be too strong for civil posse, and too sudden to admit of a formal requisition of the

<pb n="718" xml:id="mmm.uh.whitney.1892.719"/>

Governor upon the military commander. An officer finds himself resisted in the discharge of his duty, and he calls to his aid first the citizens, and, if they are not sufficient, the soldiers. This would be directly summoning a part of the troops. <hi rend="italic">A direct summons</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">requisition</hi> are not convertible terms.	*	*	*	*</p>

<p>In a Territory like <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, the person who exercises this last mentioned power can make war and peace when he pleases, and holds in his hands the issues of life and death for thousands. Surely it was not intended to cloth each one of the judges, as well as the marshal and all his deputies, with this tremendous authority. Especially does this construction seem erroneous when we reflect that these different officers might make requisitions conflicting with one another, and all of them crossing the path of the Governor.	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*</p>

<p>On the whole the President is very decidedly of opinion&#8212;</p>

<p>1. That the Governor of the Territory alone has power to issue a requisition upon the commanding-general for the whole or part of the army ;</p>

<p>2. That there was no apparent occasion for the presence of the troops at Provo.</p>

<p>3. That if a rescue of the prisoners in custody had been attempted, it was the duty of the marshal, and not of the judge, to summon the force which might be necessary to prevent it ;</p>

<p>4. That the troops ought not to have been sent to Provo, without the concurrence of the Governor, nor kept there against his remonstrance;</p>

<p>5. That the disregard of these principles and rules of action has been in many ways extremely unfortunate.</p>

<p>A strong effort was now made by the anti-Mormons to have Governor Cumming removed, and another executive, more in harmony with their views and policies, appointed in his stead. To this end a mass meeting of Gentiles convened at Camp Floyd in the latter part of July. Among those present were the Federal Judges and Dr. Garland Hurt. An address was issued, accusing the Mormons of numerous crimes, declaring that they were still disloyal, and that President Buchanan had been deceived and had done a great wrong in withdrawing from the courts the protecting power of the military.</p>

<p>That same month these "disloyal Mormons" had celebrated, in response to the following order, the natal day of American liberty: </p>

<p><hi rend="center">SPECIAL ORDER NO. 2.</hi></p>


<p><hi rend="right">HEADQUARTERS NAUVOO LEGION,</hi></p>

in a boisterous revelry, but with hearts full of gratitude to Almighty God the Great Father of our rights.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant-General directs for the celebration in this city as follows :</p>

<p>1st.&#8212;At sunrise a salute of thirteen guns will be fired, commencing near the residence of His Excellency the Governor, to be answered from a point on South Temple Street, near the residence of President <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName>.</p>

<p>The national flag will be hoisted at the signal from the first gun, simultaneously at the residences of Governor Cumming and President <persName key="Young, Brigham">Young</persName>, at the office of the Territorial Secretary, and the residence of the United States Attorney. Captain Pitt's band will be stationed at sunrise opposite the residence of Governor Cumming, and Captain Ballo's band opposite the residence of President <persName key="Young, Brigham">Young</persName>.</p>

<p>At the hoisting of the flags the bands will play the "Star Spangled Banner." </p>

<p>2nd.&#8212;After the morning salute the guns will be parked at the Court House till noon, when a salute of thirty-three guns will be fired.</p>

<p>3rd.&#8212;At sunset a salute of five guns, in honor of the Territories, will be fired and the flags lowered.</p>

<p>4th.&#8212;For the above service Lieutenant Atwood and two platoons of artillery will be detailed. Two six-pounder iron guns will be used for the salutes. Also a first lieutenant and two platoons of the 1st Cavalry will be detailed as a guard, and continue
on guard through the day. The whole detachment will be dismissed after the
sunset salute.</p>

<p>5th.&#8212;Col. J. C. Little, of the General's staff, will perform the duties of marshal of the day, with permission to select such deputies as he may require to assist him. The Declaration of Independence will be read by him from the steps of the Court House at noon.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously with the effort put forth by local Gentiles for the removal of Governor Cumming, the friends of General <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">Johnston</persName>, at Washington, brought a strong pressure to bear upon President Buchanan for the same purpose. <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">Johnston</persName> at that time was quite an influential personage. His great military ability was recognized, and he was regarded as a very likely successor to the aged veteran, Winfield Scott, General-in-Chief of the United States Army. In fact, his friends at the capital were working to that end. To the influence exerted against Governor Cumming, who was looked upon as a foe to General <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">Johnston</persName>, and was indeed a very lion in his

<pb n="720" xml:id="mmm.uh.whitney.1892.721"/>

path, President Buchanan would probably have yielded, had not that staunch friend of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, Colonel Thomas L. Kane, who also had great influence at the seat of government, and to whom the President felt particularly grateful for his recent services in the west, by a master-stroke of political strategy thwarted the scheme for the Governor's displacement.<ref target="n17">*</ref> Colonel Kane had been solicited by the Historical Society of New York City to deliver a lecture on <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> affairs, but had postponed the acceptance of the invitation. Hearing of the movement against Governor Cumming, and learning that President Buchanan had asked of a mutual friend how the proposed removal would be likely to affect Colonel Kane, the latter, being determined that Cumming, whom he regarded as a friend to the Territory, should be retained in office, saw that now was an opportune time to lecture in the metropolis on <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> affairs. Arrangements were forthwith concluded, and though suffering from an attack of pleurisy, the Colonel proceeded from Philadelphia to New York for that purpose. His effort was entirely successful. During the lecture he took particular pains to eulogize Governor Cumming for his wise and able administration, and declared him to be admirably fitted for the duties of his difficult and trying position. Next morning condensed reports of the lecture appeared in all the metropolitan newspapers and were scattered broad-cast over the country by the associated press. The result was that public opinion was turned completely in Cumming's favor, and President Buchanan, politic as ever, refused to remove him, and he was continued in office till the close of his term.</p>

<p>The advent of <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">Johnston</persName>'s army proved both a benefit and a detriment to <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>. The founding of Camp Floyd furnished a market for the products of farm, ranch and dairy, and the opportunity to

<note xml:id="n17">* President Buchanan in his message to Congress, December, 1858, says : " 1 cannot refrain from mentioning the valuable services of Colonel Thomas L. Kane, who, from motives of pure benevolence, and without any official character or pecuniary compensation, visited <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> during the last inclement winter for the purpose of contributing to the pacification of the Territory."</note>

profit by the presence of the troops was not lost sight of by the settlers in their vicinity. The merchants were naturally among the first to recognize and take advantage of the commercial chance thus afforded, and more than one contractor and middleman had good reason, from a worldly standpoint, to bless and not curse the coming of the army. In fact the community at large was greatly benefitted in a temporal way. Owing to the suspension of travel across the plains and the consequent breaking up of local business houses at the time of " the war," the people were destitute of many comforts which now, through trade with Camp Floyd, began to be re-supplied.<ref target="n18">*</ref> In exchange for flour, grain, beef, butter, eggs, poultry and dried fruits, the citizens obtained cash, clothing, tea, coffee, sugar and other necessaries. When Camp Floyd was evacuated, the government property, such as was not destroyed, was sold out at great sacrifice. Several <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> merchants there "made their start," and in a few years became very wealthy. Thus was the advent of the army of great material benefit to the Territory.</p>

<p>On the other hand evils were introduced into the community which, until then, it had never known. These, however, were more traceable to the crowds of camp-followers—those usual hangers-on to the skirts of an invading army—that came with the troops, than to the soldiers themselves. They were truly the off-scourings of civilization; thieves, gamblers and desperadoes of the worst type. Contact with such characters could not but have a debasing effect upon the morals of the people, especially the youth, some of whom became in time almost as bad and reckless as those whose evil examples they unhappily followed. Hitherto it had been the boast that <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> was almost entirely free from the vices which prevailed elsewhere. There was little if any drunkenness, no gambling, no

The result was a general breaking up of local merchants and consequent privations among the people.</note>

prostitution,&#8212;in short, none of the social evils which seem to be a concomitant of modern civilization, and are held by some sophists to be essential to the welfare of the communities they invariably corrupt and destroy. In those days it was said, and with perfect truth, that an unprotected woman might traverse the Territory from one end to another without being molested, without hearing an obscene word or witnessing an insulting gesture. But with the coming of the troops, or the camp-followers, this happy condition began to change, and before long it could with equal propriety be affirmed :</p>

<lg type="poem">

<l>Where rose aloft the voice of reverent prayer,</l>
<l>The horrid oath now rent the midnight air ;</l>
<l>O'er streets deserted ere the darkening night,</l> 
<l>The glare of sin sent forth its baleful light ;</l> 
<l>The grog-shop, held aloft from arm of law,</l> 
<l>Poured forth its poison with defiant maw ;</l>
<l>O'er walks where virtue long had wandered free,</l> 
<l>Staggered the drunkard, lurked the debauchee;</l>
<l>With watchful eye the gambler lay in wait</l>
<l>To lure his victim with a gilded bait,</l>
<l>While pimp and harlot ply their artful game</l>
<l>To drag our youth to dens of death and shame.<ref target="n19">*</ref></l>
</lg>

<p>Murders also became frequent. Now and then it was a peaceable and respectable citizen who fell a victim to the knife or bullet of the drunken desperado or midnight thief and assassin. Generally, however, it was the drunkards and desperadoes who slew each other, in which event "good riddance" was the common expression of public sentiment.</p>

<p>Among the homicides that occurred soon after the founding of Camp Floyd were the following: The shooting of Policeman <persName key="Cooke, William">William Cooke</persName>, in October, 1858, by a ruffian named McDonald, who succeeded in escaping; the killing of Sergeant <persName key="Pike, Ralph">Ralph Pike</persName> by <persName key="Spencer, Howard">Howard Spencer</persName>, in retaliation for an assault committed some time before. <persName key="Pike, Ralph">Pike</persName> had

cracked <persName key="Spencer, Howard">Spencer</persName>'s skull with a musket, and brought him nigh to death's door. He barely recovered, but when he did, sought out his assailant and shot him dead. This tragedy occurred August 11th, 1859. <persName key="Spencer, Howard">Howard Spencer</persName> was a Mormon, and Sergeant <persName key="Pike, Ralph">Pike</persName> an officer from Camp Floyd. By many, <persName key="Spencer, Howard">Spencer</persName>, at the time of the shooting, was considered insane, made so by the terrible blow he had received from the Sergeant's musket. In fact this was the ground upon which he was acquitted when tried for murder many years later.<ref target="n20">*</ref> Another murder was that of Alexander Carpenter by Thomas H. Ferguson, which has already been mentioned. All three killings occurred at <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>. Another notable homicide that took place there about the same time was the shooting of Messrs. Brewer and Johnson. This twain were gamblers and desperadoes. They were shot, it is said, at the same instant, while walking home one night together. Who their slayer or slayers were was never known. Other murders occurred in various parts of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> during this time of terror.</p>

<p>An interesting event of the summer of 1859 was the visit to our Territory of Horace Greeley, founder and editor of the New York Tribune. The great journalist was on his way to the Pacific coast, having taken his own advice and "come west," not to "grow up with the country," but to see what growth the western country had attained. He reached <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName> on Sunday evening, July 10th, by overland mail stage from the frontier. On the evening of Saturday, the 16th, a reception and supper were given in his honor,&#8212;the former at the Council House, the latter at the Globe Restaurant,&#8212;by the Deseret Typographical and Press Association. Speeches were made by Mr. Greeley and by Messrs. <persName key="Hyde, Orson">Orson Hyde</persName>, <persName key="Taylor, John">John Taylor</persName>, <persName key="Clements, Gilbert">Gilbert Clements</persName> and <persName key="Banks, John">John Banks</persName>.

and Olsen's serenade band discoursed delightful music on the occasion, and a poem composed by John Lyon, entitled "Welcome to Greeley," was read by James McKnight. Mr. Greeley's address to the printers occupied about half an hour. In his plain and peculiar style he referred to the progress the world had made during his recollection ; remarked how extraordinary had been the increase of facilities for the spread of knowledge through the press and by means of the electric telegraph, and stated that he looked forward to a day when still greater improvements would be made&#8212;when the daily newspaper, printed from continuous rolls, cut and folded by steam, would be thrown off ready for distribution at a rate far exceeding that of the rapid eight and ten cylinder presses then in use; and when the telegraph would connect, through one grand electric cur-rent, continent with continent and island with island, till every corner of the earth should be illumined with telegraphic communication. Of course Mr. Greeley, during his stay, did not omit calling on President <persName key="Young, Brigham">Young</persName>, with whom he had several long and interesting interviews.</p>

<p>In addition to the <hi rend="italic">Deseret News</hi>, the pioneer journal, <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> had at this time a paper called the <hi rend="italic">Valley Tan</hi>. It was the first Gentile print published in the Territory, and lent vigorous influence to the Federal Judges and General <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">Johnston</persName> in their antagonism to the Mormon leaders and to Governor Cumming. The first number of the <hi rend="italic">Valley Tan</hi>&#8212;a four-page weekly&#8212;was published November 5th, 1858. It was edited by Kirk Anderson, at <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>, though it originated at Camp Floyd. The next paper established was <hi rend="italic">The Mountaineer</hi>, which made its appearance on the 27th of August, 1859. Its editors and proprietors were James Ferguson, Seth M. Blair and Hosea Stout. It was an ably conducted journal and opposed the <hi rend="italic">Valley Tan</hi>.</p>

<p>On August 1st of this year recurred the biennial election of delegate to Congress. Dr. John M.

Hooper was chosen delegate.</p>

<p>The "Pony Express," to carry dispatches between the Missouri River and the Pacific coast, was inaugurated in the spring of 1860. The first express from the west reached <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName> on the 7th of April, having left Sacramento on the night of the 3rd. The first from the east, which left St. Joseph, Missouri, on the evening of April 3rd, arrived here on the evening of the 9th. This brought <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> within six days' communication with the frontier, and within seven days of the nation's capital; a result which our citizens, who were then accustomed to receiving news three months after date, duly appreciated. Said the <hi rend="italic">Deseret News</hi>: "Although a telegraph is very desirable, we feel well satisfied with this achievement for the present."</p>

<p>The first dispatches dropped by the Pony Express at <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName> contained the news of the intended introduction in the United States Senate of "a bill amendatory of the act organizing the Territory of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>." This bill, it was said, proposed that the seat of government be removed from <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName> to Carson Valley, and that the name of the Territory be changed from <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> to Nevada. According to the Washington correspondent of the St. Louis <hi rend="italic">Republican</hi>, the Committee on Territories, who were expected to report the bill, hoped by this policy to pass the political power of the Territory from Salt Lake to Carson Valley&#8212;from the hands of the Mormons to those of the Gentiles. The removal of the seat of government to Carson Valley, in connection with the rich mines lately discovered there, it was thought would attract a large Gentile population to that locality. This, however, was the last that was heard of the bill for an act to obliterate <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>.</p>

<p>Other news of a still more stirring nature was brought by the Pony Express. The air was now filled with rumors of war. Events in the east had been hastening to a crisis; the plot for secession had ripened and borne fruit, and the great internecine struggle that was to temporarily split the nation and shake the whole earth with its thunder, was just about to begin. The direct result upon <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> of the opening of the conflict was the withdrawal of the Federal troops from the Territory.</p>

<pb n="726" xml:id="mmm.uh.whitney.1892.727"/>

<p>As early as March, 1860, General <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">Johnston</persName> had left Camp Floyd for Washington, D. C. He had never visited <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName> since passing through it with the army in June, 1858. Consequently he and <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> never met. After his departure, Colonel Philip St. George Cooke became the post commander. By his order, early in February, 1861, Camp Floyd changed its name to Fort Crittenden. Secretary Floyd, for whom the post was originally named, had fallen from his allegiance and was now considered a traitor to his country. In May, 1860, most of the troops at Camp Floyd had left, pursuant to orders, for Arizona and New Mexico, and in July, 1861, the residue took up their march for the east, to participate in the war for the Union.</p>

<p>Prior to the abandonment of Camp Floyd vast stores of provisions and army supplies of all kinds were offered for sale by the military authorities and purchased by local merchants and other citizens. The sacrifice in price was enormous, and many far-sighted buyers made their fortunes. It is estimated that four million dollars worth of goods were disposed of for $100,000. This did not include arms and ammunition, great quantites of which, instead of being transported back to the States, were destroyed. Among the heaviest purchasers was President <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName>, whose agent and business manager, Colonel <persName key="Clawson, H. B.">H. B. Clawson</persName>, visited the Fort for that purpose. Walker Brothers also bought extensively, as did other <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> merchants.</p>

<p>Some of the more prominent officers accepted an invitation from Colonel Clawson, who was President <persName key="Young, Brigham">Young</persName>'s son-in-law, to visit the ex-Governor prior to their departure from the Territory. Among those who paid their respects to the Mormon leader were Colonel Cooke, Colonel Alexander, Captain Marcy and Quartermaster Crossman. All were very pleasant, the animosities of the past evidently having evaporated. These officers presented to President <persName key="Young, Brigham">Young</persName> the flag-staff from which the stars and stripes had floated over Camp Floyd. This interesting relic stood for many years on the brow of the hill near the White House, the President's early <choice><orig>resi-

dence</orig><reg>residence</reg></choice>, where it continued to bear aloft the national banner. Whatever General <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">Johnston</persName> had thought, it is evident that Colonel Cooke and his brother officers did not, at this time, deem the Mormons disloyal. The presentation of such a gift at such a time speaks volumes to the contrary. And what of General <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">Johnston</persName>, who had denounced the Saints as "rebels?" Himself a rebel now, wearing the grey instead of the blue, commanding a Confederate in lieu of a Union army, his star of life, with the star of his glory, was soon to set in a sea of blood on the fatal field of Shiloh.</p>
