<head>XXVII.</head>

<p>Captain <persName key="Tobin, John">John Tobin</persName>, late of the U. S. A., is another veteran plainsman and mountaineer.</p>

<p>If his life and adventures were written up it would make a
wonderfully thrilling and interesting book, and would read more
like romance than reality, yet the facts can all be substantiated
by indisputable authority. <seg type="Context" subtype="GunnisonMurder">He is the sole survivor of the famous Gunnison massacre.</seg></p>

<p><persName key="Tobin, John">John Tobin</persName> was born in Dungarvan, County of Weatherford, 
Ireland. At the early age of fifteen he espoused the cause of Ireland,
and attached himself to the "Young Ireland Party," and was 
engaged in the assault on the Cappoquin Barracks, in Weatherford
county. Learning that a warrant had been issued for his arrest,
he fled to England, and succeeded in boarding the ill-fated 
Tuscarora. During the voyage the captain gave orders to "smoke"
the vessel (fumigate the ship by burning tar). Through the
carelessness of one of the sailors the tar was ignited, and the
vessel caught fire, and at one time total destruction seemed 
inevitable. The hatches were ordered battened down, and, by 
almost superhuman exertions, the crew succeeded in extinguishing
the fire. When the vessel arrived near Cape May, the Captain,
by some mistake, ran her upon a coral reef, where both ship and
cargo proved a total loss. The passengers and crew were rescued
by neighboring fishermen, aided by wreckers.</p>

<p>From here the brave lad made his way to Cape May, and thence
to Philadelphia. Feeling that Ireland could never be free 
without trained military leaders, he determined upon entering the
army as soon as he should reach the requisite age. We cannot
follow the dauntless boy through all his varied and checkered
life. We will, however, relate an incident in the Captain's fitful
career that happened in 1855.</p>

<p>Young Tobin entered the army, as previously determined, and
at the time we mention was stationed at Fort Lane, Oregon,
and held the rank of sergeant of cavalry.</p>

<p>On the evening of the ninth of October, 1855, a messenger
arrived, bringing word that the Rogue River Indians were upon
the war path, and were committing all kinds of outrages against
the white settlers. He further stated that a number of men,
women, and children had been massacred and their wagon train

<pb n="492" xml:id="mmm.wa.custer.1891.507"/>

captured and carried away by the red-skins. All was now 
excitement among the troopers, and many and dire were the threats 
made against the savages. Major Fitzgerald, with one hundred 
and thirty men, including the company to which Tobin belonged, 
was ordered to proceed in the direction the hostiles were 
supposed to be, and afford what protection he could to the whites.</p>

<p>Leaving Fort Lane in the afternoon of the same day, the 
command rode rapidly toward the scene of slaughter. Night soon
overtook the rescuing party, and it proved to be a dark and
cloudy one. The route lay through a narrow tract of land
skirted on both sides with heavy timber, and the troops found it
diliieult to proceed. To <hi rend="italic">see</hi> was impossible, owing to the intense
darkness of the night. It was also dangerous, as the command 
could be easily ambuscaded and totally annihilated. The brave 
band of troopers struggled manfully on, literally <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> their
way through the intense blackness surrounding them. No 
thought of danger, no wish to delay, but all eager and anxious to
meet the savage foe. Toward morning, while riding slowly along, 
Tobin's horse shied suddenly and refused to proceed. The 
sergeant dismounted, determined to ascertain the cause of his
horse's strange action. His first thought was "Indians." Not
daring to strike a light, he groped around in the dark and
stumbled over something which, upon close inspection, proved
to be a human body, entirely naked and horribly mutilated. The
facts were reported to Major Fitzgerald, who at once ordered a
halt and detailed eight or ten men to examine the ground.</p>

<p>What was the horror of this little band of soldiers to discover
the remains of twenty dead and mutilated men, women and
children, stripped of every vestige of covering, with huge
gashes in their legs and sides; some were literally disemboweled.</p>

<p>The gray dawn of morn had by this time made its appearance,
and the sight that presented itself to the troopers was horrible in
the extreme. Scouts were immediately sent out to ascertain the
whereabouts of the Indians.</p>

<p>The scouts soon returned, and reported the Indians encamped
about four miles further on, in the midst of an open valley.
They, evidently, were not dreaming of being attacked, as they
were howling and boasting of their prowess, and dancing the
scalp dance. Major Fitzgerald, after hearing the report, 
determined to start at once and ride rapidly to the Indian camp and
begin the attack without delay.</p>

<pb n="493" xml:id="mmm.wa.custer.1891.508"/>

<pb n="495" xml:id="mmm.wa.custer.1891.510"/>

<p>For once the red man and the white would be on an equal
footing. The command arrived in the vicinity of the hostiles
about sunrise; but, owing to the open nature of the ground, a
complete surprise could not be effected. The troopers were all
well mounted, and armed with carbines, pistols and sabres. As 
they emerged from the timber and appeared in view on the
open plain, the savages quickly mounted their ponies and began
to prepare for battle, crying, "choco-choco, Basson" (come
on, come, you pale faces). Major Fitzgerald formed his men
in line of battle, and rode rapidly to within easy range of the
savages, obtaining a position that cut off the retreat to the
timber in their rear. The savages, seeing their escape was next
to impossible, prepared to make a desperate resistance.</p>

<p>The Indians outnumbered the troopers four to one. The
latter opened upon them a brisk fire of bullet and buckshot
that caused them to waver; they rallied, however, and returned
the fire with a rapid discharge of small arms and arrows.</p>

<p>It was soon apparent to all that the Indians were adopting
Siegel's tactics to "fight and retreat," and, by making a detour,
reach the forest, some three-quarters of a mile in their rear.
The commanding officer, divining their intentions, and without
giving his troops time to reload, ordered them to draw sabre and
charge. At the word of command, the men drew their sabres
and fearlessly charged upon the horde of desperate and savage
warriors.</p>

<p>The conflict now raged hand to hand, and was desperate and
bloody in the extreme.</p>

<p>Take away all hope of escape from an Indian warrior, and let
death stare him in the face, and he becomes a fiend incarnate.
Such was the condition of the hostiles who opposed Major 
Fitzgerald's command. On the other hand, the horrible scene 
witnessed by the gallant cavalrymen the night previous cried for
vengeance, and the recollection of the twenty innocent men,
women and children murdered by these same red devils would
continually arise, like Banquo's ghost, before their eyes, and
spurred them on to heroic deeds of valor. Many and sanguinary
were the hand-to-hand contests upon this hotly contested 
battleground, two opposed to three, and three to one; sabre against
spear, and knife against tomahawk.</p>

<p>Before leaving Fort Lane, Sergeant Tobin had borrowed a six-
shooter from Post Farrier Laughlin, and this, in all probability,

<pb n="496" xml:id="mmm.wa.custer.1891.511"/>
    
saved his life. In the very commencement of the battle he was 
attacked by three stalwart savages, armed with spears and 
tomahawks, who made a most determined assault upon him. Tobin 
calmly awaited their attack, and, by reserving his fire until they
were within a few feet of him, he succeeded in killing two of
them instantly and badly wounding a third, who, in his dying
struggle, gave a peculiar whoop that attracted the attention of
three more savages, who came with flying leaps to the aid of
their wounded comrade.</p>

<p>Again was Tobin in a desperate situation. He had still three
loads left in his revolver, and determined to sell his life as dearly
as possible. The foremost Indian came bounding forward,
shouting the battle-cry, and when within ten feet of our hero, 
sent his battle-axe with terrible force directly at the head of 
Tobin. Fortunately it missed the brave trooper, although passing
in uncomfortable proximity to his head. The next instant the 
savage lay writhing in death with a ball from Tobin's revolver
through his brain. Quicker than our tardy pen can trace the 
facts, the second Indian fell to rise no more. The third was but
a few feet behind his comrades, and, seeing their fate, he 
hesitated before attacking a man who had just slain five of the 
bravest warriors of the tribe.</p>

<p>The brave trooper had but one more shot left, and, although 
a man of iron nerve, and a splendid marksman, the terrific 
combat was telling upon him. Would he be as successful with the
sixth red-skin as he had been with the others? was the question
that flashed through his brain. With great care and deliberation
the warrior took aim and hurled his spear directly at the head of
<persName key="Tobin, John">John Tobin</persName>. It swerved in its course, and the long, heavy 
handle struck him a glancing blow on the side of the head that felled
him to the ground. The savage instantly sprang forward to
finish his victim, but the plucky trooper's time had not yet come.
Recovering himself, he arose to a half-sitting, half-stooping 
position. The Indian was now within three feet of him, with 
scalping knife in hand, when Tobin's bullet pierced his brain, and he
fell without a groan.</p>

<p>The battle lasted over two hours, and ranged over a space half
a mile square. Five hundred streaked and painted savages lay
dead and dying on the bloody field. One red-skin alone of all
that band of savage warriors succeeded in eluding the troopers
and reaching the timber, where he disappeared with a yell of 
defiance. All efforts to capture him proving futile.</p>

<pb n="497" xml:id="mmm.wa.custer.1891.512"/>

<p>A view of the battle ground presented a sickening sight. One
savage had buried his knife to the hilt in the breast of a trooper,
who had rctaliated by thrusting his sabre through the body of
the Indian. Both were dead, one lying across the other.</p>

<p>Now that the battle was ended, the troopers turned their 
attention to their wounded comrades, and to burying the dead.
Twenty-three troopers had made their last charge, and sorrowing
companions proceeded to give them decent burial.</p>

<p>Before the sad task was half finished a messenger arrived,
attracted by the firing, who stated that the Indians had attacked
Harris ranch, and unless aid was sent at once, the whites would
all be murdered.</p>

<p>Sergeant Tobin, with a detail of twenty-five men, was ordered
to proceed at once to the ranch and render the inmates what aid
he could. A short ride of two hours brought them to within
sight of the ranch. The place was in the hands of some fifty
savages. The troopers formed in fours, and rode boldly in the
direction of the Indians. The latter deeming discretion the 
better part of valor, discharged their arms at the troopers, and then
fled precipitately to the woods. The troops returned the fire,
but the distance being too great, no damage was done on either
side. The troopers found Mr. Harris just breathing his last,
while his wife and her fourteen-year-old daughter were tied to
trees, and but for the timely arrival of Sergeant Tobin, would 
have been subjected to a fate worse than death. The daughter
was wounded in the shoulder.</p>

<p>From these brave women Tobin learned that the Indians had
attacked the house some two hours before, and the inmates had
made a determined resistance. Mr. Harris was shot early in the 
fight, and lay upon the floor in a dying condition. The heroic
mother had taken her stand at a port hole, and kept the Indians
at bay. The women were possessed of two rifles. The young
girl did the loading and the mother did the shooting. Four 
Indians were killed by this brave woman, and several more were
wounded. It was by a combined attack from front and rear that
the Indians finally succeeded in gaining an entrance and making
captives of the inmates.</p>

<p>This was but the beginning of a series of Indian outrages that
lasted over two years, and cost the Government many valuable
lives and a large amount of money.</p>

<p>Capt. <persName key="Tobin, John">John Tobin</persName> was the veteran mountaineer who saved the 
entire Mormon hand-cart trains from destruction by risking his 
life in crossing the Rocky Mountains in winter to obtain aid from
Gov. <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> for the starving and snow-bound emigrants
in the winter of 1856.</p>

<p>He corroborates <persName key="Lee, John D.">John D. Lee</persName>'s confession of the Mountain 
Meadows massacre, an account of which we give in the following pages.</p>

<p>In order that the reader may understand the following extract,
taken from "Mormonism Unveiled," we will state that <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">a large

twenty years afterwards, was arrested, tried, convicted, and 
executed for his part in this infamous transaction. The following
is a part of his confession after he found there was no hope for
him: &#8212;</p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDSLeadership">About the 7th of September, 1857, I went to <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName> from
my home at <placeName type="settlement" key="Harmony, UT">Harmony</placeName>, by order of President <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName>. I did not
know what he wanted of me, but he had ordered me to visit him
and I obeyed. If I remember correctly, it was on Sunday 
evening that I went there. When I got to <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>, I met <persName key="Haight, Isaac C."></persName> on the public square of the town. <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> was then
President of that State of Zion, and the highest man in the 
Mormon priesthood in that country, and next to <persName key="Dame, William H.">Wm. H. Dame</persName> in
all of Southern <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, and as Lieutenant-Colonel he was second
to <persName key="Dame, William H.">Dame</persName> in the command of the Iron Military District. The
word and command of <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Isaac C. Haight</persName> were <hi rend="italic">the law</hi> in <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar
City</placeName>, at that time, and to disobey his orders was certain death;
be they right or wrong, no Saint was permitted to question them,
their duty was obedience or death.</seg></p>

<p>When I met <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName>, I asked him what he wanted with me.
He said he wanted to have a long talk with me on private and
particular business. We took some blankets and went over to
the old Iron Works, and lay there that night, so that we could
talk in private and in safety. After we got to the Iron Works,
<persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> told me all about the train of emigrants. He said (and I then believed every word that he spoke, for I believed it was
an impossible thing for one so high in the Priesthood as he was, 

<pb n="499" xml:id="mmm.wa.custer.1891.514"/>
    
to be guilty of falsehood) that <seg type="Blame" subtype="EmigrantBehavior">the emigrants were a rough and
abusive set of men. That they had, while travelling through
<placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, <seg type="Encounter" subtype="Slander">been very abusive to all the Mormons they met. That
they had insulted, outraged, and ravished many of the Mormon
women. That the abuses heaped upon the people by the 
emigrants during their trip from Provo to <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>, had been
constant and shameful</seg>; that they had burned fences and destroyed
growing crops; that <seg type="Encounter" subtype="Poison">at many points on the road they had poisoned
the water, so that all people and stock that drank of the water
became sick, and many had died from the effects of poison.</seg>
That these vile Gentiles publicly proclaimed that they had the
very pistol with which the Prophet, <persName key="Smith, Joseph">Joseph Smith</persName>, was murdered
and had threatened to kill <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> and all of the
Apostles. That when in <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName> they said they would have 
friends in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> who would hang <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> by the neck
until he was dead, before snow fell again in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">the Territory</placeName>.
<seg type="Context" subtype="UtahWar">They also said that <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">Johnston</persName> was coming, with his army, from
the East, and they were going to return from <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName> with
soldiers, as soon as possible, and would then desolate the land,
and kill every d&#8212;d Mormon man, woman and child that they
could find in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>.</seg> That they violated the ordinances of the
town of Cedar, and had, by armed force, resisted the officers
who tried to arrest them for violating the law. That after 
leaving <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName> the emigrants camped by the company, or 
co-operative field, just below <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>, and burned a large 
portion of the fencing, leaving the crops open to the large herds of
stock in the surrounding country. <seg type="Encounter" subtype="Poison">Also that they had given
poisoned meat to the Corn Creek tribe of Indians, which had
killed several of them, and their Chief, <persName key="Kanosh">Konosh</persName>, was on the trail
of the emigrants, and would soon attack them.</seg> All of these
things, and much more of a like kind</seg>, <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> told me as we lay
in the dark at the old Iron Works. I believed all that he said, 
and, thinking that he had full right to do all that he wanted to
do, I was easily induced to follow his instructions.</p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Planning"><persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> said that unless something was done to prevent it, the
emigrants would carry out their threats and rob every one of the
outlying settlements in the South, and that the whole Mormon
people were liable to be butchered by the troops that the 
emigrants would bring back with them from <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName>. I was then
told that the Council had held a meeting that day, to consider
the matter, and that <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">it was decided by the authorities to arm

<pb n="500" xml:id="mmm.wa.custer.1891.515"/>
        
the Indians, give them provisions and ammunition, and send them
after the emigrants, and have the Indians give them a <hi rend="italic">brush</hi>,
and if they killed part or all of them, so much the better.</seg></seg></seg></p>

<p>I said, "Brother <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName>, who is your authority for acting in
this way?"</p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDSLeadership">He replied, <seg type="Context" subtype="UtahWar">"It is the <hi rend="italic">will of all in authority</hi>. The emigrants
have no pass from any one to go through the country, and they
are liable to be killed as common enemies, for the country is at
war now. No man has a right to go through this county 
without a written pass."</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDSLeadership"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Planning">We lay there and talked much of the night, and during that
time <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> gave me very full instructions what to do, and how
to proceed in the whole affair. He said he had consulted with
Colonel <persName key="Dame, William H.">Dame</persName>, and <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">every one agreed to let the Indians use up
the whole train if they could.</seg> <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> then said: &#8212;</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDSLeadership"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Planning">"I expect you to carry out your orders."</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDSLeadership">I knew I had to obey or die. I had no wish to disobey, for I
then thought that my superiors in the Church were the mouth-

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDSLeadership">General <persName key="Smith, George A.">George A. Smith</persName> held high rank as a military leader. He was one of the twelve apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="IndianRelationsLDS">"No," I said, "he is a Mormon."</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="IndianRelationsLDS">The Indians then wanted to know more. They wanted to have

Indians were true to the Mormons and would help them against
their enemies, then the Mormons would always keep them from
want and sickness and give them guns and ammunition to hunt
and kill game with, and would also help the Indians against their
enemies when they went into war.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="IndianRelationsLDS">This talk pleased the Indians, and they agreed to all that I
asked them to do.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="IndianRelationsLDS">I saw that my friend <persName key="Smith, George A.">Smith</persName> was a little nervous and fearful of

<p>We had ridden along about a mile or so when General <persName key="Smith, George A.">Smith</persName>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">I said I thought they would attack any train that would come

bragging of the part they took in helping kill our prophets, what do 
you think the brethren would do with them?</seg> Would they be 
permitted go their way, or would the brethren pitch into them and
give them a good drubbing?"</seg></p>

<p> I reflected a few moments, and then said: &#8212;</p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="LDSReformation">"You know the brethren are now under the influence of the

or some one in authority, they will certainly never get safely 
through this country.</p>

<p>My reply pleased him very much, and he laughed heartily, and
then said: &#8212;</p>

<p>"Do you really believe the brethren would make it lively for
such a train?"</p>

<p>I said: "Yes, sir; I know they will, unless they are protected 
by a pass, and I wish to inform you that unless <hi rend="italic">you want every
train captured</hi> that comes through here, you must inform 
Governor <persName key="Young, Brigham">Young</persName> that if he wants emigrants to pass without being 
molested, he must send orders to that effect to Colonel <persName key="Dame, William H.">Wm. H.

will, except the positive orders of Governor <persName key="Young, Brigham">Young</persName>, <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDSZealots">as the

and <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDSBloodAtonement">anxious to avenge the blood of the Prophets</seg>."</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Planning">The only reply he made was to the effect that on his way down

on the same subject, and that <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> had assured him, and
given him to understand that emigrants who came along 
without a pass from Governor <persName key="Young, Brigham">Young</persName> could not escape from <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">the

<p>We then rode along in silence for some distance, when he again
turned to me and said: &#8212;</p>

the country making threats and abusing our people.</seg>"</p>

<pb n="505" xml:id="mmm.wa.custer.1891.520"/>

<p>I repeated my views to him, but at much greater length, 
giving my reasons in full for thinking that Governor <persName key="Young, Brigham">Young</persName> should
give orders to protect all the emigrants that he did not wish
destroyed. I went into a full statement of the wrongs of our
people, and told him that <seg type="Context" subtype="LDSReformation">the people were under the blaze of
the reformation, full of wild fire and fanaticism, and that <seg type="Context" subtype="LDSPersecution">to
shed the blood of those who would <hi rend="italic">dare to speak</hi> against the
Mormon Church or its leaders, they would consider doing the
will of God,</seg> and that the people would do it as willingly and

when he started forth to persecute the followers of Christ, was
not any more sincere than every Mormon was then, who lived in
Southern <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName></seg>.</p>

<p>My words served to cheer up <persName key="Smith, George A.">the General</persName> very much; he was
greatly delighted and said: &#8212;</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear so good an account of our people. God
will bless them for all that they do to build up His Kingdom in

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Planning">General <persName key="Smith, George A.">Smith</persName> did not say one word to me, or intimate to me,

many as four hundred of them. The two chiefs who were shot
in the knee were in a bad fix. The Indians had killed a number
of the emigrants' horses, and about sixty or seventy head of

killed for spite and revenge.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Planning">Our company killed a small beef for dinner, and after eating

three balls from their guns cut my clothing. One ball went
through my hat and cut my hair on the side of my head. One
ball went through my shirt and leaded my shoulder, the other
cut my pants across my bowels. I thought this was rather warm
work, but I kept on until I reached the place were the Indians
were in force. When I got to them, I told them the Great Spirit
would be mad at them if they killed the women and children. I
talked to them some time, and cried with sorrow when I saw that
I could not pacify the savages.</seg></seg></p>

<p>When the Indians saw me in tears, they called me "Yaw

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Planning">On Thursday, about noon, several men came to us from <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar

<persName key="Wilden, Alexander">Alexander Wilden</persName>, <persName key="Hopkins, Charles">Charles Hopkins</persName> and &#8212; <persName key="Tate">Tate</persName>, came to us
at the camp at the springs. These men said but little, but every
man seemed to know just what he was there for. As our 
messenger had gone for further orders, we moved our camp about
four hundred yards further up the valley on to a hill, where we
made camp as long as we staid there</seg></seg>.</p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">I soon learned that <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">the whites were as wicked at heart as the
Indians</seg>, for every little while during that day I saw white men
taking aim and shooting at the emigrants' wagons. They said
they were doing it to keep in practice and to <hi rend="italic">help pass off the

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">I remember one man that was shooting, that rather amused
me, for he was shooting at a mark over a quarter of a mile off,
and his gun would not carry a ball two hundred yards. That
man was <persName key="Wilden, Alexander">Alexander Wilden</persName>. He took pains to fix up a seat
under the shade of a tree, where he continued to load and shoot
until he got tired. Many of the others acted just as wild and
foolish as <persName key="Wilden, Alexander">Wilden</persName> did.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">The wagons were corraled after the Indians had made the first
attack. On the second day after our arrival the emigrants drew 
their wagons near each other and chained the wheels one to the
other. While they were doing this there was no shooting going
on. Their camp was about one hundred yards above and north
of the spring. They generally got their water from the spring
at night.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">Thursday morning I saw two men start from the corral with

<pb n="511" xml:id="mmm.wa.custer.1891.526"/>
    
buckets, and run to the spring and fill their buckets with water,
and go back again. The bullets flew around them thick and fast,
but they got into their corral in safety.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">The Indians had agreed to keep quiet until orders returned
from <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName>, but they did not keep their word. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Dates">They made a

home that day and <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">drove off quite a number of cattle with them</seg>.</seg>
During the day I said to <persName key="Mangum, John">John Mangum</persName>,</p>

<p>"I will cross over the valley and go up on the other side, on
the hills to the west of the corral, and take a look at the 
situation."</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">I did go. As I was crossing the valley I was seen by the
emigrants, and as soon as they saw that I was a white man they
ran up a <hi rend="italic">white</hi> flag in the middle of their corral, or camp. They
then sent two little boys from the camp to talk to me, but I
could not talk to them at that time, for I did not know what
orders <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> would send back to me, and until I did know his
orders I did not know how to act. I hid, to keep away from the
children. They came to the place where they had last seen me
and hunted all around for me, but being unable to find me, they
turned and went back to the camp in safety.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">While the boys were looking for me several Indians came to
me and asked for ammunition with which to kill them.</seg> <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">I told
them they must not hurt the children&#8212;that if they did I would
kill the first one that made the attempt to injure them. By this
act I was able to save the boys.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">It is all false that has been told about little girls being dressed
in white and sent out to me. There never was anything of the
kind done.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">I staid on the west side of the valley for about two hours,
looking down into the emigrant camp, and feeling all the torture
of mind that it is possible for a man to suffer who feels merciful,
I and yet knows, as I then knew, what was in store for that 
unfortunate company if the Indians were successful in their bloody
designs.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">While I was standing on the hill looking down into the corral,
I saw two men leave the corral and go outside to cut some

along at their work until they had it done, and then they went
back into camp. The men all acted so bravely that it was
impossible to keep from respecting them.</seg></p>

<p>After staying there and looking down into the camp until I
was nearly dead from grief, I returned to the company at camp.
I was worn out with trouble and grief; I was nearly wild 
waiting for word from the authorities at <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>. I prayed for
word to come that would enable me to save that band of

I am not positive that he was, but my best impression is that he

<p>As soon as these persons gathered around the camp, I

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDSLeadership"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Planning">Major <persName key="Higbee, John M.">Higbee</persName> reported as follows: "It is the orders of the

the Territory, and that as these were our sworn enemies, they

<p>I then told them that God would have to change my heart

killing of that people. I attempted to reason with <persName key="Higbee, John M.">Higbee</persName> and
the brethren. I told them how strongly the emigrants were

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDSLeadership">I then left the Council, and went away to myself, and bowed

Our leaders speak with inspired tongues, and their orders come

any of the emigrants that might escape from the first assault.

<p>The troops formed in two lines, as had been agreed upon, and

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">I walked ahead of the wagons up to the corral. When I

He loosened the chains from some of their wagons, and moved
one wagon out of the way, so that our teams could drive inside
of the corral and into their camp. It was then noon, or a little
after.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Location">I found that the emigrants were strongly fortified; their
wagons were chained to each other in a circle. In the centre was a
rifle-pit, large enough to contain the entire company. This had
served to shield them from the constant fire of their enemy,
which had been poured into them from both sides of the valley,
from a rocky range that served as a breastwork for their 
assailants. The valley at this point was not more than five hundred
yards wide, and the emigrants had their camp near the centre of
the valley. On the east and west there was a low range of 
rugged, rocky mountains, affording a splendid place for <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS"><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">the
protection of the Indians and Mormons</seg>,</seg> and leaving them in 
comparative safety while they fired upon the emigrants. The valley at
this place runs nearly due north and south.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS"><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">When I entered the corral, I found the emigrants engaged in
burying two men of note among them, who had died but a short
time before from the effect of wounds received by them from
the Indians at the time of the first attack on Tuesday morning.</seg>
They wrapped the bodies up in buffalo robes, and buried them
in a grave inside the corral. I was then told by some of the men
that <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">seven men were killed and seventeen others were wounded
at the first attack by the Indians, and that three of the wounded
men had since died, making ten of their number killed during
the siege.</seg></seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDSLeadership"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">As I entered the fortifications, men, women and children
gathered around me in wild consternation. Some felt that the time
of their happy deliverance had come, while others, though in 
deep distress, and all in tears, looked upon me with doubt, 
distrust and terror. My feelings at this time may be imagined (but
I doubt the power of man being equal to even imagine how
wretched I felt). No language can describe my feelings. My
position was painful, trying and awful; my brain seemed to be
on fire; my nerves were for a moment unstrung; humanity was
overpowered, as I thought of the cruel, unmanly part that I was

acting. Tears of bitter anguish fell in streams from my eyes;
my tongue refused its office; my faculties were dormant, 
stupefied and deadened by grief. I wished that the earth would open
and swallow me where I stood. God knows my suffering was
great. I cannot describe my feelings. I knew that I was acting
a cruel part and doing a damnable deed. Yet my faith in the
godliness of my leaders was such that it forced me to think that
I was not sufficiently spiritual to act the important part I was
commanded to perform. My hesitation was only momentary.
Then feeling that duty compelled <hi rend="italic">obedience to orders</hi>, I laid
aside my weakness and my humanity, and became an instrument
in the hands of my superiors and my leaders. I delivered my
message and told the people that they must put their arms in the
wagon, so as not to amuse the animosity of the Indians. I 
ordered the children and wounded, some clothing and arms, to be
put into the wagons. Their guns were mostly Kentucky rides of
the muzzle-loading style. Their ammunition was about all gone &#8212;
I do not think there were twenty loads left in the whole camp.
If the emigrants had had a good supply of ammunition they
never would have surrendered, and I do not think we could have
captured them without great loss, for they were brave men and
very resolute and determined.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDSLeadership"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">Just as the wagons were loaded, <persName key="McFarland, Daniel">Dan. McFarland</persName> came riding

return and renew the attack before he could get the emigrants to a
place of safety.</seg></seg></p>

<persName key="McFarland, Daniel">Dan. McFarland</persName> rode before the women and led them right up
to the troops, where they still stood in open order as I left them.

yards behind the hindmost woman.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">The women and children were hurried right on by the troops.

sight of the troops, over the hill. I had disobeyed orders in
part by turning off as I did, for I was anxious to be out of sight
of the bloody deed that I knew was to follow. I knew that I
had much to do yet that was of a cruel and unnatural character.
It was my duty, with the two drivers, to kill the sick and
wounded who were in the wagons, and to do so when we heard
the guns of the troops fire. I was walking between the wagons:
the horses were going in a fast walk, and we were fully half a
mile from Major <persName key="Higbee, John M.">Higbee</persName> and his men, when we heard the firing.
As we heard the guns, I ordered a halt and we proceeded to do
our part.</seg></seg></p>

the head. I was told by <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> afterwards that the child was

<persName key="McMurdy, Samuel">McMurdy</persName> and <persName key="Knight, Samuel">Knight</persName> got out of their wagons; each one had a

several women. In one place I saw six or seven bodies near each

other; they were stripped perfectly naked, and <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">all of their
clothing was torn from their bodies by the Indians</seg></seg></seg>.</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Aftermath"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">I walked along the line where the emigrants had been killed,
and saw many bodies lying dead and naked on the field, near by 
where the women lay. I saw ten children; they had been killed
close to each other; they were from ten to sixteen years of age. 
The bodies of the women and children were scattered along the 
ground for quite a distance before I came to where the men were
killed.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">I do not know how many were killed, but I thought then that
there were some fifteen women, about ten children, and about 
forty men killed, but the statement of others that I have since
talked with about the massacre, makes me think there were fully 
one hundred and ten killed that day <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Location">on <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">the Mountain Meadows</geogName></seg> 
and that the ten who had died in the corral, and young <persName key="Aden, William A.">Aden</persName> killed
by <persName key="Stewart, William C.">Stewart</persName> at Richards' Springs, would make the total number one
hundred and twenty-one.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">When I reached the place where the dead men lay, I was told
how the orders had been obeyed. Major <persName key="Higbee, John M.">Higbee</persName> said: "The 
boys have acted admirably, they took good aim, and all of the 
d&#8212;d Gentiles but two or three fell at the <hi rend="italic">first fire</hi>."</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">He said that three or four got away some distance, but the
men on horses soon overtook them and cut their throats.</seg> <persName key="Higbee, John M.">Higbee</persName>
said <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">the Indians did their part of the work well, that it did not
take over a minute to finish up when they got fairly started.</seg> <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Planning">I
found that the first orders had been carried out to the letter.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">Three of the emigrants did get away, but the Indians were
put on their trail and they overtook and killed them before they 
reached the settlements in <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName>. But it would take more
time than I have to spare to give the details of their chase and
capture. I may do so in my writings hereafter, but not now.</seg></seg></p>

<p>I found Major <persName key="Higbee, John M.">Higbee</persName>, <persName key="Klingensmith, Philip">Klingensmith</persName>, and most of the brethren
standing near by where the largest number of the dead men lay.
When I went up to the brethren, Major <persName key="Higbee, John M.">Higbee</persName> said: &#8212;</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">"We must now examine the bodies for valuables."</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">I said I did not wish to do any such work.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils"><persName key="Higbee, John M.">Higbee</persName> then said, "Well, you hold my hat and I will examine
the bodies, and put what valuables I get into the hat."</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">The bodies were all searched by <persName key="Higbee, John M.">Higbee</persName>, <persName key="Klingensmith, Philip">Klingensmith</persName> and
<persName key="Stewart, William C.">Wm. C. Stewart</persName>. I did hold the hat a while, but I soon got so 
sick that I had to give it to some other person, as I was unable 

<pb n="527" xml:id="mmm.wa.custer.1891.542"/>
    
to stand for a few minutes. The search resulted in getting a
little money and a few watches, but there was not much money.
<persName key="Higbee, John M.">Higbee</persName> and <persName key="Klingensmith, Philip">Klingensmith</persName> kept the property, I suppose, for I
never knew what became of it, unless they did keep it. I think
they kept it all.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">After the dead were searched, as I have just said, the brethren
were called up, and <persName key="Higbee, John M.">Higbee</persName> and <persName key="Klingensmith, Philip">Klingensmith</persName>, as well as myself,
made speeches, and <hi rend="italic">ordered</hi> the people to keep the matter a
secret from the <hi rend="italic">entire</hi> world. Not to tell their wives, or their
most intimate friends, and we pledged ourselves to keep 
everything relating to the affair a secret during life. We also took the
most binding oaths to stand by each other, and <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">to always insist
that the massacre was committed by Indians alone.</seg> This was
the advice of <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName>, too, as I will show hereafter.</seg></p>

<p>The men were mostly ordered to camp there on the field for
that night, but <persName key="Higbee, John M.">Higbee</persName> and <persName key="Klingensmith, Philip">Klingensmith</persName> went with me to 
<persName key="Hamblin, Jacob">Hamblin</persName>'s ranch, where we got something to eat, and staid there all
night. I was nearly dead for rest and sleep: in fact, I had rested
but little since the Saturday night before. I took my saddle-
blanket and spread it on the ground soon after I had eaten my
supper, and lay down on the saddle-blanket, using my saddle for
a pillow, and slept soundly until next morning.</p>

<p>I was awakened in the morning by loud talking between <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Isaac
C. Haight</persName> and <persName key="Dame, William H.">William H. Dame</persName>. They were very much excited,
and quarreling with each other. I got up at once, but was unable
to hear what they were quarreling about, for they cooled down as
soon as they saw that others were paying attention to them.</p>

<p>I soon learned that Col. <persName key="Dame, William H.">Dame</persName>, Judge <persName key="Lewis, James">Lewis</persName> of <placeName type="settlement" key="Parowan, UT">Parowan</placeName>, and
<persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Isaac C. Haight</persName>, with several others, had arrived at the 
<persName key="Hamblin, Jacob">Hamblin</persName> ranch in the night, but I do not know what time they got
there.</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Aftermath">After breakfast we all went back in a body to<geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows"> the Meadows</geogName>
to bury the dead and <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">take care of the property that was left
there</seg>.</seg></p>
    
<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Aftermath"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">When we reached <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">the Meadows</geogName> we all rode up to that part of
the field where the women were lying dead. The bodies of men,
women and children had been stripped entirely naked, making
the scene one of the most loathsome and ghastly that can be
imagined.</seg></seg></p>

<p>Knowing that <persName key="Dame, William H.">Dame</persName> and <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> had quarreled at <persName key="Hamblin, Jacob">Hamblin</persName>'s 
that morning, <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDSLeadership">I wanted to know how they would act in sight of

<pb n="528" xml:id="mmm.wa.custer.1891.543"/>
    
the dead, who lay there as the result of their orders. </seg>I was
greatly interested to know what <persName key="Dame, William H.">Dame</persName> had to say, so I kept
close to them, without appearing to be watching them.</p>

<p>Colonel <persName key="Dame, William H.">Dame</persName> was silent for some time. He looked all over
the field, and was quite pale, and looked uneasy and frightened.
I thought then that he was just finding out the difference 
between giving and executing orders for wholesale killing. He
spoke to <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName>, and said: &#8212;</p>

<p>"I must report this matter to the authorities.'</p>

<p>"How will you report it?" said <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName>.</p>

<p><persName key="Dame, William H.">Dame</persName> said, "I will report it just as it is."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so, and implicate yourself with the rest?"
said <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName>.</p>

<p>"No," said <persName key="Dame, William H.">Dame</persName>. "I will not implicate myself, for I had
nothing to do with it."</p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDSLeadership"><persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> then said, "That will not do, for you know a d&#8212;d sight better. You ordered it done. Nothing has been done except by your orders, and it is too late in the day for you to
order things done and then go back on it, and go back on the 
men who have carried out your orders. You cannot <hi rend="italic">sow pig</hi> on
me, and I will be d&#8212;d if I will stand it. You are as much to
blame as any one, and you know that we have done nothing 
except what you ordered done. I know that I have obeyed orders,
and by G&#8212;d I will not be lied on."</seg></p>

<p>Colonel <persName key="Dame, William H.">Dame</persName> was much excited. He choked up, and would
have gone away, but he knew <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> was a man of 
determination, and would not stand any foolishness.</p>

<p>As soon as Colonel <persName key="Dame, William H.">Dame</persName> could collect himself, he said:&#8212;</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">"I did not think there were so many of them, or I would not
have had anything to do with it."</hi></p>

<p>Colonel <persName key="Dame, William H.">Dame</persName> was perfectly cowed. He did not offer to deny it again.</p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Aftermath">After the dead were covered up or buried</seg>, the brethren were
called together and all took a most solemn oath, binding 
themselves under the most dreadful and awful penalties, to keep the
whole matter secret from every human being, as long as they 
should live.</seg></p>
