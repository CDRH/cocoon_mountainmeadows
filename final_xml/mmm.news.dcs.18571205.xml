He further informs us that it would be impossible for the Indians to plan an attack upon even a single train, for years no small party of Americans has ever been safe in travelling this route.  As a matter of necessity, all small trains have assumed the name of Mormons to travel safely.</seg>  These Indians are well armed with rifles, and supplied with ammunition by the Mormon, and at the time of the passage of the United States troops through their country in 1855 every effort was made by the Mormons to induce the Indians to attack them&#8212;and they were only prevented from so doing by the superior strength and great precaution shown by the troops.</seg>  This fact was communicated to the War Department at the time in an official report.</seg>&#8212;<hi rend="italic">N.
