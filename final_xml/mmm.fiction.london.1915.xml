<head>CHAPTER XII</head>

<p>Now that I had learned the trick, the way was easy. And I knew the way was bound to become easier the more I traveled it. Once establish a line of least resistance, every succeeding journey along it will find still less resistance. And so, as you shall see, my journeys from <placeName type="settlement" key="San Quentin, CA">San Quentin</placeName> life into other lives, were achieved almost automatically as time went by.</p>

<p>After Warden Atherton and his crew had left me, it was a matter of minutes to will the resuscitated portion of my body back into the little death. Death in life it was, but it was only the little death, similar to the temporary death produced by an anesthetic.</p>

<p>And so, from all that was sordid and vile, from brutal solitary and jacket hell, from acquainted flies and sweats of darkness and the knuckle-talk of the living dead, I was away at a bound into time and space.</p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">Came the duration of darkness, and the slow-growing awareness of other things and of another self. First of all, in this awareness, was dust. It was in my nostrils, dry and acrid. It was on my lips. It coated my face, my hands, and especially was it noticeable on the fingertips when touched by the ball of my thumb.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">Next, I was aware of ceaseless movement. All that was about me lurched and oscillated. There was jolt and jar, and I heard what I knew as a matter of course to be the grind of wheels on axles and the grate and clash of iron tires against rock and sand. And there came to me the jaded voices of men, in curse and snarl of slow-plodding jaded animals.</seg></p>

<pb n="107" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.120"/>
                
<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="Route">I opened my eyes, that were inflamed with dust, and immediately fresh dust bit into them. On the coarse blankets on which I lay the dust was half an inch thick. Above me, through sifting dust, I saw an arched roof of lurching, swaying canvas, and myriads of dust motes descended heavily in the shafts of sunshine that entered through holes in the canvas.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">I was a child, a boy of eight or nine, and I was weary, as was the woman, dusty-visaged and haggard, who sat up beside me and soothed a crying babe in her arms. She was my mother; that I knew as a matter of course, just as I knew, when I glanced along the canvas tunnel of the wagon-top, that the shoulders of the man on the driver's seat were the shoulders of my father.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">When I started to crawl along the packed gear with which the wagon was laden, my mother said in a tired and querulous voice, "Can't you ever be still a minute, Jesse?"</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">That was my name, Jesse. I did not know my surname, though I heard my mother call my father John. I have a dim recollection of hearing, at one time or another, the other men address my father as captain. I knew that he was the leader of this company, and that his orders were obeyed by all.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">I crawled out through the opening in the canvas and sat down beside my father on the seat. The air was stifling with the dust that rose from the wagons and <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">the many hoofs of the animals</seg>. So thick was the dust that it was like mist or fog in the air, and the low sun shone through it dimly and with a bloody light.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">Not alone was the light of this setting sun ominous, but everything about me seemed ominous&#8212;the landscape, my father's face, the fret of the babe in my mother's arms that she could not still, the six horses my father drove that had continually to be urged and that were without any sign of color so heavily had the dust settled on them.</seg></p>

<pb n="108" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.121"/>
                
<p>The landscape was an aching, eye-hurting desolation. Low hills stretched endlessly away on every hand. Here and there only on their slopes were occasional scrub growths of heat-parched brush. For the most part, the surface of the hills was naked-dry and composed of sand and rock. Our way followed the sand-bottoms between the hills. And the sand-bottoms were bare, save for spots of scrub, with here and there short tufts of dry and withered grass. Water there was none, nor sign of water, except for washed gullies that told of ancient and torrential rams.</p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">My father was the only one who had horses to his wagon. The wagons went in single file, and as the train wound and curved, I saw that the other wagons were drawn by oxen. Three or four yoke of oxen strained and pulled weakly at each wagon, and beside them, in the deep sand, walked <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">men with ox-goads</seg> who prodded the unwilling beasts along. On a curve I counted the wagons ahead and behind. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">I knew that there were forty of them, including our own</seg>; for often I had counted them before. And as I counted them now, as a child will to while away tedium, they were all there, forty of them, all canvas-topped, big and massive, crudely fashioned, pitching and lurching, I grinding and jarring over sand and sage brush and rock.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">To right and left of us, scattered along the train, rode <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">a dozen or fifteen men and youths on horses</seg>. Across their pommels were long-barreled rides. Whenever any of them drew near to our wagon, I could see that their faces, under the dust, were drawn and anxious like my father's. And my father, like them, had a long-barreled rifle close to hand as he drove.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">Also, to one side, limped a score or more of footsore, yoke-galled, skeleton oxen, that ever paused to nip at the occasional tufts of withered grass, and that ever were prodded on by the tired-faced youths who herded them.

<pb n="109" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.122"/>

Sometimes, one or another of these oxen would pause and low, and such lowing seemed as ominous as all else about me.</seg></seg></p>

<p>Far, far away, I have a memory of having lived, a smaller lad, by the tree-lined banks of a stream. And as the wagon jolts along and I sway on the seat with my father, I continually return and dwell upon that pleasant water flowing between the trees. <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">I have a sense that for an interminable period I have lived in a wagon and traveled on, ever on, with this present company.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">But strongest of all upon me is what is strong upon all the company, namely, a sense of drifting to doom. Our way was like a funeral march. Never did a laugh arise. Never did I hear a happy tone of voice. Neither peace nor ease marched with us. The faces of the men and youths who outrode the train were grim, set, hopeless. And as we toiled through the lurid dust of sunset, often I scanned my father's face in vain quest of some message of cheer. I will not say that my father's face, in all its dusty haggardness, was hopeless. It was dogged, and, oh, so grim, and anxious, most anxious.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">A thrill seemed to run along the train. My father's head went up. So did mine. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">And our horses raised their weary heads, scented the air with long-drawn snorts, and for the nonce pulled willingly. The horses of the out-riders quickened their pace. And as for the herd of scare-crow oxen, it broke into a forthright gallop. It was almost ludicrous. The poor brutes were so clumsy in their weakness and haste. They were galloping skeletons draped in mangy hides, and they outdistanced the boys who herded them. But this was only for a time. Then they fell back to a walk, a quick, eager, shambling, sore-footed walk; and they no longer were lured aside by the dry bunch-grass</seg>.</seg></p>

<p>"What is it?" my mother asked from within the wagon.</p>

<pb n="110" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.123"/>
                
<p>"Water," was my father's reply. "It must be <placeName type="settlement" key="Nephi, UT">Nephi</placeName>."</p>

<p><seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">And my mother: "Thank God! And perhaps they will sell us food."</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="Route">And into <placeName type="settlement" key="Nephi, UT">Nephi</placeName>, through blood-red dust, with grind and grate and jolt and jar, our great wagons rolled. A dozen scattered dwellings or shanties composed the place. The landscape was much the same as that through which we had passed. There were no trees, only scrub growths and sandy bareness. But here were signs of tilled fields, with here and there a fence. Also, there was water. Down the stream ran no current. The bed, however, was damp, with now and again a water-hole into which the loose oxen and the saddle horses stamped and plunged their muzzles to the eyes. Here, too, grew an occasional small willow.</seg></p>

<p>"That must be Bill Black's mill they told us about," my father said, pointing out a building to my mother, whose anxiousness had drawn her to peer out over our shoulders.</p>

<p>An old man, with buckskin shirt and long, matted, sunburnt hair, rode back to our wagon and talked with father. The signal was given, and the head wagons of the train began to deploy in a circle. The ground favored the evolution, and, from long practice, it was accomplished without a hitch, so that when the forty wagons were finally halted they formed a circle. All was bustle and orderly confusion. Many women, all tired-faced and dusty like my mother, emerged from the wagons. Also, poured forth a very horde of children. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">There must have been at least fifty children</seg></seg>, and it seemed I knew them all of long time; and <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">there were at least two score of women</seg>. These went about the preparations for cooking supper.</p>

<p>While some of the men chopped sagebrush, and we children carried it to the fires that were kindling, other men

<pb n="111" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.124"/>
                
unyoked <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">the oxen</seg> and let them stampede for water. Next, the men, in big squads, moved the wagons snugly into place. The tongue of each wagon was on the inside of the circle, and, front and rear, each wagon was in solid contact with the next wagon before and behind. The great brakes were locked fast; but, not content with this, the wheels of all the wagons were connected with chains. This was nothing new to us children. It was the trouble sign of a camp in hostile country. One wagon only was left out of the circle, so as to form a gate to the corral. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">Later on, as we knew, ere the camp slept, the animals would be driven inside, and the gate-wagon would be chained like the others in place. In the meanwhile, and for hours, the animals would be herded by men and boys to what scant grass they could find.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">While the camp-making went on, my father, with several others of the men including the old man with the long, sunburnt hair, went away on foot in the direction of the mill. I remember that all of us, men, women, and even the children, paused to watch them depart; and it seemed their errand was of grave import.</seg></p>

<p>While they were away, other men, strangers, inhabitants of desert <placeName type="settlement" key="Nephi, UT">Nephi</placeName>, came into camp and stalked about. They were white men, like us, but they were hard-faced, sternfaced, somber, and they seemed angry with all our company. Bad feeling was in the air, and they said things calculated to muse the tempers of our men. But the warning went out from the women, and was passed on everywhere to our men and youths, that there must be no words.</p>

<p>One of the strangers came to our fire, where my mother was alone cooking. I had just come up with an armful of sagebrush, and I stopped to listen and to stare at the intruder whom I hated because it was in the air to hate, because I knew that every last person in our company

<pb n="112" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.125"/>
                
hated these strangers who were white-skinned like us and because of whom we had been compelled to make our camp in a circle.</p>

<p>This stranger at our fire had blue eyes, hard and cold and piercing. His hair was sandy. His face was shaven to the chin, and from under the chin, covering the neck and extending to the ears, sprouted a sandy fringe of whiskers well-streaked with gray. Mother did not greet him, nor did he greet her. He merely stood and glowered at her for some time. Then he cleared his throat and said with a sneer:</p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationMissouri">"Wisht you was back in <placeName type="state" key="Missouri">Missouri</placeName> right now, I bet."</seg></p>

<p>I saw mother tighten her lips in self-control ere she answered:</p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas">"We are from <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName>."</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="LDSPersecution">"I guess you've got good reasons to deny where you come from," he next said, "you that drove the Lord's chosen people from <placeName type="state" key="Missouri">Missouri</placeName>."</seg></p>

<p>Mother made no reply.</p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="LDSPersecution"><seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">" . . . Seein'," he went on, after the pause accorded her, "as you're now comin' a-whinin' an' a-beggin' bread at our hands that you persecuted."</seg></seg></p>

<p>Whereupon, and instantly, child that I was, I knew anger, the old, red, intolerant wrath, ever unrestrainable and unsubduable.</p>

<p>"You lie!" I piped up. "<seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationMissouri">We ain't Missourians</seg>. <seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">We ain't whinin'. An' we ain't beggars. We got the money to buy.</seg>"</p>

<p>"Shut up, Jesse!" my mother cried, landing the back of her hand stingingly on my mouth. And then, to the stranger, "Go away and let the boy alone."</p>

<p><seg type="Encounter" subtype="Slander"><seg type="Context" subtype="LDSPersecution">"I'll shoot you full of lead, you damned Mormon!" I screamed and sobbed at him, too quick for my mother this time and dancing away around the fire from the backsweep of her hand.</seg></seg></p>

<pb n="113" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.126"/>
                
<p>As for the man himself, my conduct had not disturbed him in the slightest. I was prepared for I knew not what violent visitation from this terrible stranger, and I watched him warily while he considered me with the utmost gravity.</p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="EmigrantBehavior">At last he spoke, and he spoke solemnly, with solemn shaking of the head, as if delivering a judgment.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="EmigrantBehavior">"Like fathers like sons," he said. "The young generation is as bad as the older. The whole breed is unregenerate and damned. There is no saving it, the young or the old. There is no atonement. Not even the blood of Christ can wipe out its iniquities."</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Encounter" subtype="Slander"><seg type="Context" subtype="LDSPersecution">"Damned Mormon!" was all I could sob at him. "Damned Mormon! Damned Mormon! Damned Mormon!"</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Encounter" subtype="Slander"><seg type="Context" subtype="LDSPersecution">And I continued to damn him and to dance around the fire before my mother's avenging hand, until he strode away.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">When my father, and the men who had accompanied him, returned, camp-work ceased, while all crowded anxiously about him. He shook his head.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">"They will not sell?" some woman demanded.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">Again he shook his head.</seg></p>

<p>A man spoke up, a blue-eyed, blond-whiskered giant of thirty, who abruptly pressed his way into the center of the crowd.</p>

<p><seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">"They say they have flour and provisions for three years, Captain," he said. "They have always sold to the immigration before. And now they won't sell. And it ain't our quarrel. <seg type="Context" subtype="UtahWar">Their quarrel's with the government, an' they're takin' it out on us.</seg> It ain't right, Captain. It ain't right, I say, us with our women an' children, an' <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="Route"><placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName> months away, winter comin' on, an' nothin' but desert in between.</seg> We ain't got the grub to face the desert."</seg></p>

<pb n="114" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.127"/>
                
<p>He broke off for a moment to address the whole crowd.</p>

<p>"Why, you-all don't know what desert is. This around here ain't desert. I tell you it's paradise, and heavenly pasture, an' flowin' with milk an' honey alongside what we're goin' to face.</p>

<p><seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">"I tell you, Captain, we got to get flour first. If they won't sell it, then we must just up an' take it."</seg></p>

<p>Many of the men and women began crying out in approval, but my father hushed them by holding up his hand.</p>

<p>"I agree with everything you say, Hamilton," he began. But the cries now drowned his voice, and he again held up his hand.</p>

<p>"Except one thing you forgot to take into account, Hamilton&#8212;a thing that you and all of us must take into account. <seg type="Context" subtype="UtahWar"><persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> has declared martial law, and <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> has an army. We could wipe out <placeName type="settlement" key="Nephi, UT">Nephi</placeName> in the shake of a lamb's tail and take all the provisions we can carry. But we wouldn't carry them very far. <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham</persName>'s Saints would be down upon us and we would be wiped out in another shake of a lamb's tail. You know it. I know it. We all know it.</seg>"</p>

<p>His words carried conviction to listeners already convinced. What he had told them was old news. They had merely forgotten it in a flurry of excitement and desperate need.</p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="EmigrantBehavior">"Nobody will fight quicker for what is right than I will," father continued. "But it just happens we can't afford to fight now. If ever a ruction starts we haven't a chance. And we've all got our women and children to recollect. We've got to be peaceable at any price, and put up with whatever dirt is heaped on us."</seg></p>

<p>"But what will we do with the desert coming?" cried <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">a woman who nursed a babe at her breast.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="Route"><seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">"There's several settlements before we come to the

<pb n="115" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.128"/>
                
desert," father answered. "<placeName type="settlement" key="Fillmore, UT">Fillmore</placeName>'s sixty miles south. Then comes <placeName type="settlement" key="Corn Creek, UT">Corn Creek</placeName>. And <placeName type="settlement" key="Beaver, UT">Beaver</placeName>'s another fifty miles. Next is <placeName type="settlement" key="Parowan, UT">Parowan</placeName>. Then it's twenty miles to <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>. The farther we get away from <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake</placeName> the more likely they'll sell us provisions."</seg></seg></p>

<p>"And if they won't?" the same woman persisted.</p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="EmigrantBehavior">"Then we're quit of them," said my father. "<placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName> is the last settlement. We'll have to go on, that's all, and thank our stars we are quit of them. Two days' journey beyond is good pasture and water. They call it <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">Mountain Meadows</geogName>. Nobody lives there, and that's the place we'll rest <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">our cattle </seg>and feed them up before we tackle the desert. Maybe we can shoot some meat. And if the worst comes to the worst, we'll keep going as long as we can, then abandon the wagons, pack what we can on our animals, and make the last stages on foot. We can eat our cattle as we go along.

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="EmigrantBehavior">With final reiterated warnings against violence of speech or act, the impromptu meeting broke up. I was slow in falling asleep that night. My rage against the Mormon had left my brain in such a tingle that I was still awake when my father crawled into the wagon after a last round of the night-watch. They thought I slept, but I heard mother ask him if he thought that the Mormons would let us depart peacefully from their land. His face was turned aside from her as he busied himself with pulling off a boot, while he answered her with hearty confidence that he was sure the Mormons would let us go if none of our own company started trouble.</seg></p>

<p>And I awoke to the old pain of the jacket in solitary. About me were the customary four: Warden Atherton, Captain Jamie, Doctor Jackson, and Al Hutchins. I cracked my face with my willed smile, and struggled not to lose control under the exquisite torment of returning circulation. I drank the water they held to me, waved aside the proffered bread, and refused to speak. I closed my eyes and strove to win back to the chain-locked wagon-circle at <placeName type="settlement" key="Nephi, UT">Nephi</placeName>. But so long as my visitors stood about me and talked I could not escape.</p>

<p>One snatch of conversation I could not tear myself away from hearing.</p>

<p>"Just as yesterday," Doctor Jackson said. "No change one way or the other."</p>

<p>"Then he can go on standing it?" Warden Atherton queried.</p>

<p>"Without a quiver. The next twenty-four hours as easy as the last. He's a wooz, I tell you, a perfect wooz. If I didn't know it was impossible, I'd say he was doped."</p>

<p>"I know his dope," said the warden. "It's that cursed will of his. I'd bet, if he made up his mind, that he could walk barefoot across red-hot stones like those Kanaka priests from the South Seas."</p>

<p>Now perhaps it was the word "priests" that I carried away with me through the darkness of another flight in time. Perhaps it was the cue. More probably it was a mere coincidence. At any rate I awoke, lying upon a rough rocky floor, and found myself on my back, my arms crossed in such fashion that each elbow rested in the palm of the opposite hand. As I lay there, eyes closed, half awake, I rubbed my elbows with my palms and found

<pb n="117" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.130"/>
                
that I was rubbing prodigious callouses. There was no surprise in this. I accepted the callouses as of long time and a matter of course.</p>

<p>I opened my eyes. My shelter was a small cave, no more than three feet in height and a dozen in length. It was very hot in the cave. Perspiration noduled the entire surface of my body. Now and again several nodules coalesced and formed tiny rivulets. I wore no clothing save a filthy rag about the middle. My skin was burned to a mahogany brown. I was very thin, and I contemplated my thinness with a strange sort of pride, as if it were an achievement to be so thin. Especially was I enamored of my painfully prominent ribs. The very sight of the hollows between them gave me a sense of solemn elation, or, rather, to use a better word, of sanctification.</p>

<p>My knees were calloused like my elbows. I was very dirty. My beard, evidently once blond, but now a dirt-stained and streaky brown, swept my midriif in a tangled mass. My long hair, similarly stained and tangled, was all about my shoulders, while wisps of it continually strayed in the way of my vision so that sometimes I was compelled to brush it aside with my hands. For the most part, however, I contented myself with peering through it like a wild animal from a thicket.</p>

<p>Just at the tunnel-like mouth of my dim cave the day reared itself in a wall of blinding sunshine. After a time I crawled to the entrance, and, for the sake of greater discomfort, lay down in the burning sunshine on a narrow ledge of rock. It positively baked me, that terrible sun, and the more it hurt me the more I delighted in it, or in myself rather, in that I was thus the master of my flesh and superior to its claims and remonstrances. When I found under me a particularly sharp, but not too sharp, rock-projection, I ground my body upon the point of it, 

<pb n="118" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.131"/>
                
roweled my flesh in a very ecstasy of mastery and of purifcation.</p>

<p>It was a stagnant day of heat. Not a breath of air moved over the river valley on which I sometimes gazed. Hundreds of feet beneath me the wide river ran sluggishly. The farther shore was flat and sandy and stretched away to the horizon. Above the water were scattered clumps of palm trees.</p>

<p>On my side, eaten into a curve by the river, were lofty, crumbling cliffs. Farther along the curve, in plain view from my eyrie, carved out of the living rock, were four colossal figures. It was the stature of a man to their ankle joints. The four colossi sat, with hands resting on knees, with arms crumbled quite away, and gazed out upon the river. At least, three of them so gazed. Of the fourth, all that remained was the lower limbs to the knees and the huge hands resting on the knees. At the feet of this one, ridiculously small, crouched a sphiux; yet this sphinx was taller than I.</p>

<p>I looked upon these carven images with contempt, and spat as I looked. I knew not what they were, whether forgotten gods or unremembered kings. But to me they were representative of the vanity and futility of earth men and earth aspirations.</p>

<p>And over all this curve of river and sweep of water and wide sands beyond, arched a sky of aching brass undecked by the tiniest cloud.</p>

<p>The hours passed while I roasted in the sun. Often, for quite decent intervals, I forgot my heat and pain in dreams and visions and in memories. All this, I knew&#8212;crumbling colossi, and river and sand and sun and brazen sky&#8212;was to pass away in the twinkling of an eye. At any moment the trumps of the archangels might sound, th estars fall out of the sky, the heavens roll up as a scroll,

<pb n="119" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.132"/>
                
and the Lord God of all come with his hosts for the final Judgment.</p>

<p>Ah, I knew it so profoundly that I was ready for such sublime event. That was why I was here in rags and filth and wretchedness. I was meek and lowly, and I despised the frail needs and passions of the flesh. And I thought with contempt, and with a certain satisfaction, of the far cities of the plain I had known, all unheeding, in their pomp and lust, of the last day so near at hand. Well, they would see soon enough but too late for them. And I should see. But I was ready. And to their cries and lamentations would I arise, reborn and glorious, and take my well-earned and rightful place in the City of God.</p>

<p>At times, between dreams and visions in which I was verily and before my time in the City of God, I conned over in my mind old discussions and controversies. Yes, Novatus was right in his contention that penitent apostates should never again be received into the churches. Also, there was no doubt that Sabellianism was conceived of the devil. So was Constantine, the arch-fiend, the devil's right hand.</p>

<p>Continually I returned to contemplation of the nature of the unity of God, and went over and over the contentions of Noetus, the Syrian. Better, however, did I like the contentions of my beloved teacher, Arius. Truly, if human reason could determine anything at all, there must have been a time, in the very nature of sonship, when the Son did not exist. In the nature of sonship there must have been a time when the Son commenced to exist. A father must be older than his son. To hold otherwise were a blasphemy and a belittlement of God.</p>

<p>And I remembered back to my young days when I had sat at the feet of Arius, who had been a presbyter of the city of Alexandria, and who had been robbed of the

<pb n="120" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.133"/>
                
bishopric by the blasphemous and heretical Alexander. Alexander the Sabellianite, that is what he was, and his feet had fast hold of hell."</p>

<p>Yes, I had been to the Council of Nicea, and seen it avoid the issue. And I remembered when the Emperor Constantinehad banished Arius for his uprightness. And I remembered when Constantine repented for reasons of state and policy and commanded Alexander&#8212;the other Alexander, thrice cursed, Bishop of Constantinople&#8212;to receive Arius into communion on the morrow. And that very night did not Arius die on the street? They said it was a violent sickness visited upon him in answer to Alexander's prayer to God. But I said, and so said all we Arians, that the violent sickness was due to a poison, and that the poison was due to Alexander himself, Bishop of Constantinople and devil's poisoner.</p>

<p>And here I ground my body back and forth on the sharp stones, and muttered aloud, drunken with conviction: "Let the Jews and Pagans mock. Let them triumph, for their time is short. And for them there will be no time after time."</p>

<p>I talked to myself aloud a great deal on that rocky shelf overlooking the river. I was feverish, and on occasion I drank sparingly of water from a stinking goatskin. This goatskin I kept hanging in the sun that the stench of the skin might increase and that there might be no refreshment of coolness in the water. Food there was, lying in the dirt on my cave-floor&#8212;a few roots and a chunk of moldy barley-cake; and hungry I was, although I did not eat.</p>

<p>All I did that blessed, livelong day, was to sweat and swelter in the sun, mortify my lean flesh upon the rock, gaze out on the desolation, resurrect old memories, dream dreams, and mutter my convictions aloud.</p>

<p>And when the sun set, in the swift twilight I took a

<pb n="121" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.134"/>

last look at the world so soon to pass. About the feet of the colossi I could make out the creeping forms of beasts that laired in the once proud works of men. And to the snarls of the beasts I crawled into my hole, and, muttering and dozing, visioning fevered fancies and praying that the last day come quickly, I ebbed down into the darkness of sleep.</p>

<milestone unit="section" rend="space"/>

<p>Consciousness came back to me in solitary, with the quartet of torturers about me.</p>

<p>"Blasphemous and heretical warden of San Quentin whose feet have fast hold of hell," I gibed, after I had drunk deep of the water they held to my lips. "Let the jailers and the trusties triumph. Their time is short, and for them there is no time after time."</p>

<p>"He's out of his head," Warden Atherton affirmed.</p>

<p>"He's putting it over on you," was Doctor Jackon's surer judgment.</p>

<p>"But he refuses food," Captain Jamie protested.</p>

<p>"Huh, he could fast forty days and not hurt himself," the doctor answered.</p>

<p>"And I have," I said, "and forty nights as well. Do me the favor to tighten the jacket and then get out of here."</p>

<p>The head trusty tried to insert his foreiinger inside the lacing.</p>

<p>"You couldn't get a quarter of an inch of slack with block and tackle," he assured them.</p>

<p>"Have you any complaint to make, Standing?" the warden asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," was my reply. "On two counts."</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"First," I said, "the jacket is abominably loose. Hutchins is an ass. He could get a foot of slack if he wanted."</p>

<pb n="122" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.135"/>
                
<p>"What is the other count?" Warden Atherton asked.</p>

<p>"That you are conceived of the devil, Warden."</p>

<p>Captain Jamie and Doctor Jackson tittered, and the warden, with a snort, led the way out of my cell.</p>

<p>Left alone, I strove to go into the dark and gain back to the wagon circle at Nephi. I was interested to know the outcome of that doomed drifting of our forty great wagons across a desolate and hostile land, and I was not at all interested in what came of the mangy hermit with his rock-roweled ribs and stinking water-skin. And I gained back, neither to Nephi nor the Nile, but to&#8212;</p>

<p>But here I must pause the narrative, my reader, in order to explain a few things and make the whole matter easier to your comprehension, This is necessary, because my time is short in which to complete my jacket-memoirs. In a little while, in a very little while, they are going to take me out and hang me. Did I have the full time of a thousand lifetimes, I could not complete the last details of my jacket experiences. Wherefore, I must briefen the narrative.</p>

<p>First of all, Bergson is right. Life cannot be explained in intellectual terms. As Confucius said long ago: "When we are so ignorant of life, can we know death?" And ignorant of life we truly are when we cannot explain it in terms of the understanding. We know life only phenomenally, as a savage may know a dynamo; but we know nothing of life noumenonally, nothing of the nature of the intrinsic stuff of life.</p>

<p>Secondly, Marinetti is wrong when he claims that matter is the only mystery and the only reality. I say, and as you, my reader, realize, I speak with authority&#8212;I say that matter is the only illusion. Compte called the world, which is tantamount to matter, the great fetich, and I agree with Compte.</p>

<pb n="123" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.136"/>
                
<p>It is life that is the reality and the mystery. Life is vastly diiferent from mere chemic matter fluxing in high modes of motion. Life persists. Life is the thread of fire that persists through all the modes of matter. I know I am life. I have lived ten thousand generations. I have lived millions of years. I have possessed many bodies. I, the possessor of these many bodies, have persisted. I am life. I am the unquenched spark ever flashing and astonishing the face of time, ever working my will and wreaking my passion on the cloddy aggregates of matter, called bodies, which I have transiently inhabited.</p>

<p>For look you. This finger of mine, so quick with sensation, so subtle to feel, so delicate in its multifarious dexterities, so firm and strong to crook and bend or stiifen by means of cunning leverages&#8212;this finger is not I. Cut it off. I live. The body is mutilated. I am not mutilated. The spirit that is I, is whole.</p>

<p>Very well. Cut off all my fingers. I am I. The spirit is entire. Cut off both hands. Out off both arms at the shoulder-sockets. Cut off both legs at the hip-sockets. And I, the unconquerable and indestructible I, survive. Am I any the less for these mutilations, for these subtractions of the flesh? Certainly not. Clip my hair. Shave from me with sharp razors my lips, my nose, my ears&#8212;ay and tear out the eyes of me by the roots land there, mewed in that featureless skull that is attached to a hacked and mangled torso there in that cell of the chemic flesh, will still be I, uhmutilated, undiminished.</p>

<p>Oh, the heart still beats. Very well. Cut out the heart, or, better, fling the flesh-remnant into a machine of a thousand blades and make mince meat of it&#8212;and I <hi rend="italic">I</hi>, don't you understand, all the spirit and the mystery and the vital fire and life of me, am off and away. I have not perished. Only the body has perished, and the body is not I.</p>

<pb n="124" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.137"/>
                
<p>I believe Colonel de Rochas was correct when he asserted that under the compulsion of his will he sent the girl Josephine, while she was in hypnotic trance, back through the eighteen years she had lived, back through the silence and the dark ere she had been born, back to the light of a previous living when she was a bed-ridden old man, the ex—artilleryman, Jean-Claude Bourdon. And I believe that Colonel de Rochas did truly hypnotize this resurrected shade of the old man and, by compulsion of will, send him back through the seventy years of his life, back into the dark and through the dark into the light of day when he had been the wicked old woman, Philoméne Carteron.</p>

<p>Already, have I not shown you, my reader, that in previous times, inhabiting various cloddy aggregates of matter, I have been Count Guillaume de Sainte-Maure, a mangy and nameless hermit of Egypt, and the boy, Jesse, whose father was captain or forty wagons in the great westward emigration. And, also, am I not now, as I write these lines, Darrell Standing, under sentence of death in Folsom Prison and one time professor of agronomy in the College of Agriculture of the University of California?</p>

<p>Matter is the great illusion. That is, matter manifests itself in form, and form is apparitional. Where, now, are the crumbling rock-cliffs of old Egypt where once I laired me like a wild beast while I dreamed of the City of God? Where, now, is the body of Guillaume de Sainte-Mauro that was thrust through on the moonlit grass so long ago by the flame-headed Guy de Villehardouin? Where now are the forty great wagons in the circle at Nephi, and all the men and women and children and lean cattle that sheltered inside that circle? All such things no longer are, for they were forms, manifestations of fluxing matter ere they melted into the flux again. They have passed and are not.</p>

<p>And now my argument becomes plain. The spirit is the reality that endures. I am spirit, and I endure. I,

<pb n="125" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.138"/>

Darrell Standing, the tenant of many fleshly tenements, shall write a few more lines of these memoirs and then pass on my way. The form of me that is my body will fall apart when it has been sufficiently hanged by the neck, and of it naught will remain in all the world of matter. In the world of spirit the memory of it will remain. Matter has no memory, because its forms are evanescent, and what is engraved on its forms perishes with the forms.</p>

<p>One word more, ere I retufn to my narrative. In all my journeys through the dark into other lives that have been mine, I have never been able to guide any journey to a particular destination. Thus, many new experiences of old lives were mine before ever I chanced to return to the boy, Jesse, at Nephi. Possibly, all told, I have lived over Jesse's experiences a score of times, sometimes taking up his career when he was quite small in the Arkansas settlements, and at least a dozen times carrying on past the point where I left him at Nephi. It were a waste of time to detail the whole of it; and so, without prejudice to the verity of my account, I shall skip much that is vague and tortuous and repetitional, and give the facts as I have assembled them out of the various times, in whole and part, as I relived them.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII</head>

<p>LONG before daylight the camp at <placeName type="settlement" key="Nephi, UT">Nephi</placeName> was astir. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">The cattle were driven out to water and pasture.</seg> While the men unchained the wheels and drew the wagons apart and clear for yoking in, the women cooked forty breakfasts over forty fires. The children, in the chill of dawn, clustered about the fires, sharing places, here and there, with the last relief of the night watch waiting sleepily for coffee.</p>

<p>It requires time to get a large train such as ours under way, for its speed is the speed of the slowest. So the sun was an hour high and the day was already uncomfortably hot, when we rolled out of <placeName type="settlement" key="Nephi, UT">Nephi</placeName> and on into the sandy barrens. No inhabitant of the place saw us off. All chose to remain indoors, thus making our departure as ominous as they had made our arrival the night before.</p>

<p>Again it was long hours of parching heat and biting dust, sagebrush and sand, and a land accursed. No dwellings of men, neither cattle nor fences, nor any sign of human kind, did we encounter all that day; and at night we made our wagon-circle beside an empty stream, in the damp sand of which we dug many holes that filled slowly with water seepage.</p>
    
<p>Our subsequent journey is always a broken experience to me. We made camp so many times, always with the wagons drawn in circle, that to my child mind a weary long time passed after <placeName type="settlement" key="Nephi, UT">Nephi</placeName>. But always, strong upon all of us, was that sense of drifting to an impending and I certain doom.</p>

<p>We averaged about ifteen miles a day. I know, for my

<pb n="127" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.140"/>
                
father had said it was sixty miles to <placeName type="settlement" key="Fillmore, UT">Fillmore</placeName>, the next Mormon settlement, and we made three camps on the way. This meant four days of traveL From <placeName type="settlement" key="Nephi, UT">Nephi</placeName> to the last camp of which I have any memory, we must have taken two weeks or a little less.</p>

<p>At <placeName type="settlement" key="Fillmore, UT">Fillmore</placeName>, the inhabitants were hostile, as all had been since <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake</placeName>. <seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">They laughed at us when we tried to buy food</seg>, and <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationMissouri"><seg type="Context" subtype="LDSPersecution">were not above taunting us with being Missourians.</seg></seg></p>

<p>When we entered the place, hitched before the largest house of the dozen houses that composed the settlement, were two saddle horses, dusty, streaked with sweat, and drooping. The old man I have mentioned, the one with long sunburnt hair and buckskin shirt and who seemed a sort of aide or lieutenant to father, rode close to our wagon and indicated the jaded saddle animals with a cock of his head.</p>

<p>"Not sparin' horseflesh, Captain," he muttered in a low voice. "An' what in the name of Sam Hill are they hard-riding for if it ain't for us?</p>

<p>But my father had already noted the condition of the two animals, and my eager eyes had seen him. And I had seen his eyes flash, his lips tighten, and haggard lines form for a moment on his dusty face. That was all. But I put two and two together, and knew that the two tired saddle horses were just one more added touch of ominousness to the situation.</p>

<p>"I guess they're keeping an eye on us, Laban," was my father's sole comment.</p>

<p>It was at <placeName type="settlement" key="Fillmore, UT">Fillmore</placeName> that I saw a man that I was to see again. He was a tall, broad-shouldered man, well on in middle age, with all the evidence of good health and immense strength&#8212;strength not alone of body but of will. Unlike most men I was accustomed to about me, he was smooth-shaven. Several days' growth of beard showed

<pb n="128" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.141"/>

that he was already well-grayed. His mouth was unusually wide, with thin lips tightly compressed as if he had lost many of his front teeth. His nose was large, square, and thick. So was his face square, wide between the cheekbones, underhung with massive jaws, and topped with a broad, intelligent forehead. And the eyes, rather small, a little more than the width of an eye apart, were the bluest blue I had ever seen.</p>

<p><seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">It was at the flour mill at <placeName type="settlement" key="Fillmore, UT">Fillmore</placeName> that I first saw this man. Father, with several of our company, had gone there to try to buy flour, and I, disobeying my mother in my curiosity to see more of our enemies, had tagged along unperceived. This man was one of four or five who stood in a group with the miller during the interview.</seg></p>

<p>"You seen that smooth-faced old cuss?" Laban said to father, after we had got outside and were returning to camp.</p>

<p>Father nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, that's <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName>," Laban continued. "I seen'm in <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake</placeName>. He's a regular son-of-a-gun. <seg type="Context" subtype="Polygamy">Got nineteen wives and fifty children, they all say.</seg> An' he's rank crazy on religion. Now what's he followin' us up for through this Godforsaken country?"</p>

<p><seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS"><seg type="Context" subtype="LDSPersecution">Our weary, doomed drifting went on. The little settlements, wherever water and soil permitted, were from twenty to fifty miles apart. Between stretched the barrenness of sand and alkali and drought. And at every settlement our peaceful attempts to buy food were vain. They denied us harshly, and wanted to know who of us had sold them food when we drove them from <placeName type="state" key="Missouri">Missouri</placeName>. <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas">It was useless on our part to tell them we were from <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName>. From <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName> we truly were</seg>, <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationMissouri">but they insisted on our being Missourians.</seg></seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="Route">At <placeName type="settlement" key="Beaver, UT">Beaver</placeName>, five days' journey south from <placeName type="settlement" key="Fillmore, UT">Fillmore</placeName>, we saw <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> again. And again we saw hard-ridden horses

tethered before the houses. But we did not see <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> at <placeName type="settlement" key="Parowan, UT">Parowan</placeName>.</seg></p>

<p><placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName> was the last settlement. Laban, who had ridden on ahead, came back and reported to father. His first news was significant.</p>

<p>"I seen that <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> skeedaddling out as I rid in, Captain. An' there's more men-folk an' horses in <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName> than the size of the place'd warrant."</p>

<p>But we had no trouble at the settlement. <seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">Beyond refusing to sell us food, they left us to ourselves.</seg> The women and children stayed in the houses, and, though some of the men appeared in sight, they did not, as on former occasions, enter our camp and taunt us.</p>

<p>It was at <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName> that the Wainwright baby died. I remember Mrs. Wainwright weeping and pleading with Laban to try to get some cow's milk.</p>

<p>"It may save the baby's life," she said." And they've got cow's milk. I saw fresh cows with my own eyes. Go on, please, Laban. It won't hurt you to try. They can only refuse. But they won't. Tell them it's for a baby, a wee little baby. Mormon women have mother's hearts. They couldn't refuse a cup of milk for a wee little baby."</p>

<p>And Laban tried. But as he told father afterward, he did not get to see any Mormon women. He saw only the Mormon men, who turned him away.</p>

<p>This was the last Mormon outpost. Beyond lay the waste desert, with, on the other side of it, the dream land, ay, the myth land, of <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName>. As our wagons rolled out of the place in the early morning, I, sitting beside my father on the driver's seat, saw Laban give expression to his feelings. We had gone perhaps half a mile, and were topping a low rise that would sink <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName> from view, when Laban turned his horse aroimd, halted it, and stood up in the stirrups. Where he had halted was a new-made grave, and I knew it for the Wainwright baby's&#8212;not

the first of our graves since we had crossed the Wasatch Mountains.</p>

<p>He was a weird figure of a man. Aged and lean, long-faced, hollow-cheeked, with matted, sunburnt hair that fell below the shoulders of his buckskin shirt, his face was distorted with hatred and helpless rage. Holding his long rifle in his bridle-hand, he shook his free fist at <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>.</p>

<p>"God's curse on all of you! " he cried out. "On your children, and on your babes unborn. May drought destroy your crops. May you eat sand seasoned with the venom of rattlesnakes. May the sweet water of your springs turn to bitter alkali. May . . ."</p>

<p>Here his words became indistinct as our wagons rattled on; but his heaving shoulders and brandishing fist attested that he had only begun to lay the curse. That he expressed the general feeling in our train was evidenced by the many women who leaned from the wagons, thrusting out gaunt forearms and shaking bony, labor-malformed fists at the last of Mormondom. A man, who walked in the sand and goaded the oxen of the wagon behind ours, laughed and waved his goad. It was unusual, that laugh, for there had been no laughter in our train for many days.</p>

<p>"Give'm hell, Laban," he encouraged. "Them's my sentiments."</p>

<p>And as our train rolled on, I continued to look back at Laban, standing in his stirrups by the baby's grave. Truly, he was a weird figure, with his long hair, his moccasins, and fringed leggins. So old and weather-beaten was his buckskin shirt that ragged filaments, here and there, showed where proud fringes once had been. He was a man of flying tatters. I remember, at his waist, dangled dirty tufts of hair that, far back in the journey, after a shower of rain, were wont to show glossy black, [sic]

These I know were Indian scalps, and the sight of them always thrilled me.</p>

<p>"It will do him good," father commended, more to himself than to me. "I've been looking for days for him to blow up."</p>

<p>"I wish he'd go back and take a couple of scalps," I volunteered.</p>

<p>My father regarded me quizzically.</p>

<p>"Don't like the Mormons, eh, son?"</p>

<p>I shook my head and felt myself swelling with the inarticulate hate that possessed me.</p>

<p>"When I grow up," I said, after a minute, "I'm goin' gunning for them."</p>

<p>"You, Jesse!" came my mother's voice from inside the wagon. "Shut your mouth instanter." And to my father: "You ought to be ashamed letting the boy talk on like that."</p>

<p>Two days' journey brought us to <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">Mountain Meadows</geogName>, and here, well beyond the last settlement, for the first time we did not form the wagon circle. The wagons were roughly in a circle, but there were many gaps, and the wheels were not chained. Preparations were made to stop a week. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">The cattle must be rested for the real desert</seg>, though this was desert enough in all seeming. The same low hills of sand were about us, but sparsely covered with scrub brush. The flat was sandy, but there was some grass&#8212;more than we had encountered in many days. Not more than a hundred feet from camp was a weak spring that barely supplied human needs. But farther along the bottom various other weak springs emerged from the hillsides, and it was at these that the cattle watered.</p>

<p>We made camp early that day, and, because of the program to stay a week, there was a general overhauling of soiled clothes by the women, who planned to start washing on the morrow. Everybody worked till nightfall.

While some of the men mended harness, others repaired the frames and ironwork of the wagons. There was much heating and hammering of iron and tightening of bolts and nuts. And I remember coming upon Laban, sitting cross-legged in the shade of a wagon and sewing away till nightfall on a new pair of moccasins. He was the only man in our train who wore moccasins and buckskin, and I have an impression that he had not belonged to our company when it left <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName>. Also, he had neither wife, nor family, nor wagon of his own. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">All he possessed was his horse, his rifle, the clothes he stood up in, and a couple of blankets that were hauled in the Mason wagon.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Dates">Next morning</seg> it was that our doom fell. Two days' journey beyond the last Mormon outpost, knowing that no Indians were about and apprehending nothing from the Indians on any count, for the first time we had not chained our wagons in the solid circle, placed guards on the cattle, nor set a night watch.</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">My awakening was like a nightmare. It came as a sudden blast of sound. I was only stupidly awake for the first moments and did nothing except to try to analyze and identify the various noises that went to compose the blast that continued without let up. I could hear near and distant explosions of rifles, shouts and curses of men, women screaming and children bawling. Then I could make out the thuds and squeals of bullets that hit wood and iron in the wheels and under-construction of the wagon. Whoever it was that was shooting, the aim was too low.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">When I started to rise, my mother, evidently just in the act of dressing, pressed me down with her hand. Father, already up and about, at this stage erupted into the wagon.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">"Out of it!" he shouted. "Quick! To the ground!" He wasted no time. With a hook-like clutch that was almost a blow, so swift was it, he flung me bodily out of

the rear end of the wagon. I had barely time to crawl out from under when father, mother and the baby came down pell mell where I had been.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">"Here, Jesse!" father shouted to me, and I joined him in scooping out sand behind the shelter of a wagon-wheel. We worked bare-handed and wildly. Mother joined in.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">"Go ahead and make it deeper, Jesse," father ordered.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">He stood up and rushed away in the gray light, shouting commands as he ran. (I had learned by now my surname. I was Jesse Fancher. My father was Captain Fancher.</seg>)</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">"Lie down!" I could hear him. "Get behind the wagon wheels and burrow in the sand! Family men, get the women and children out of the wagons! Hold your fire! No more shooting! Hold your fire and be ready for the rush when it comes! Single men, join Laban at the right, Cochrane at the left, and me in the center! Don't stand up! Crawl for it!"</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">But no rush came. For a quarter of an hour the heavy and irregular firing continued. Our damage had come in the first moments of surprise when a number of the early-rising men were caught exposed in the light of the campfires they were building. <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">The Indians&#8212;for Indians Laban declared them to be&#8212;had attacked us from the open, and were lying down and firing at us.</seg> In the growing light father made ready for them.

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">From left, right, and center, our rifles loosed in a volley. <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">I had popped my head up to see, and I could make out more than one stricken Indian.

Four were dead, and three were dying. Other men, wounded, were being cared for by the women. Little Rish Hardacre had been struck in the arm by a heavy ball. He was no more than six, and I remember looking on with mouth agape while his mother held him on her lap and his father set about bandaging the wound. Little Rish had stopped crying. I could see the tears on his cheeks while he stared wonderingly at a sliver of broken bone sticking out of his forearm.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">Granny White was found dead in the Foxwell wagon. She was a fat and helpless old woman who never did anything but sit down all the time and smoke a pipe. She was the mother of Abby Foxwell. And Mrs. Grant had been killed. Her husband sat beside her body. He was very quiet. There were no tears in his eyes. He just sat there, his rifle across his knees, and everybody left him alone.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">Under father's directions the company was working like so many beavers. The men dug a big ride pit in the center of the corral, forming a breastwork out of the displaced sand. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">Into this pit the women dragged bedding, food, and all sorts of necessaries from the wagons.</seg> All the children helped.

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">From time to time, during the morning of that first day, we observed clouds of dust that advertised the movements of considerable bodies of mounted men. These clouds of dust came toward us, hemming us in on all sides. But we saw no living creature. One cloud of dust only, moved away from us. It was a large cloud, and everybody said it was our cattle being driven off. And our forty great wagons that had rolled over the Rockies and half across the continent, stood in a helpless circle. Without cattle, they could roll no farther.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="RescueAttempt">Not until morning did I hear of the return of Abel Milliken and Timothy Grant, but I was not long in learning.

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">This morning of the second day, our men, going for water, were fired upon. The spring was only a hundred feet outside our circle, but <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">the way to it was commanded by the Indians who now occupied the low hill to the east.

But the Indians were not good shots, evidently, for our men brought in the water without being hit.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">Beyond an occasional shot into camp, the morning passed quietly. We had settled down in the rifle pit, and, being used to rough living, were comfortable enough. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">Of course, it was bad for the families of those who had been killed, and there was the taking care of the wounded.

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle"><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">On the low hill to the east the Indians kept up a tremendous powwowing and yelling. But beyond an occasional harmless shot, they did nothing.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">"What's the matter with the ornery cusses?" Laban impatiently wanted to know. "Can't they make up their minds what they're goin' to do, an' then do it?"</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">It was hot in the corral that afternoon. The sun blazed down out of a cloudless sky, and there was no wind. The men, lying with their rifles in the trench under the wagons, were partly shaded; but the big rifle pit, in which were over a hundred women and children, was exposed to the full power of the sun. Here, too, were the wounded men, over whom we erected awnings of blankets. It was crowded and stifling in the pit, and I was forever stealing out of it to the firing line and making a great to do at carrying messages for father.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">Our grave mistake had been in not forming the wagon circle so as to inclose the spring. This had been due to the excitement of the first attack, when we did not know how quickly it might be followed by a second one. And now it was too late. At fifteen rods' distance from <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">the Indian position on the hill</seg>, we did not dare unchain our wagons. Inside the corral, south of the graves, we constructed a latrine, and, north of the rifle pit in the center, a couple of men were told off by father to dig a well for water.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle"><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">Laban was for trying a long shot at him, but father stopped him, saying that it was evident the whites had not made up their minds what they were going to do with us, and that a shot at <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> might hurry them into making up their minds the wrong way.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">"Here, Jesse," father said to me, tearing a strip from the sheet and fastening it to an ox-goad. "Take this and go out and try to talk to that man.

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">Then there was the Indian position on the hill to the east. We managed to climb a low hill so as to look into this position.

<p>When we got back into the corral, the first thing that happened to me was a smack from mother for having staid away so long; but father praised Jed and me when we gave our report.</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">I was sitting directly alongside of him, holding the baby, when the attack burst on us. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">It was sundown, and I was staring with all my eyes at Silas Dunlap, who was just in the final act of dying. His wife, Sarah, had one hand resting on his forehead. Both she, and her Aunt Martha, were crying softly.</seg> And then it came&#8212;explosions and bullets from hundreds of rifles. Clear around from east to west by way of the north, they had strung out in half a circle and were pumping lead into our position. Everybody in the rifle pit flattened down. Lots of the younger children set up a squalling, and it kept the women busy hushing them. Some of the women screamed at first, but not many.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">Thousands of shots must have rained in on us in the next few minutes. How I wanted to crawl out to the trench under the wagons where our men were keeping up a steady but irregular fire! Each was shooting on his own whenever he saw a man to pull trigger on. But mother suspected me, for she made me crouch down and keep right on holding the baby.</seg></p>

quivering&#8212;when the little Castleton baby was killed. Dorothy Castleton, herself only about ten, was holding it, so that it was killed in her arms. She was not hurt at all. I heard them talking about it, and they conjectured that the bullet must have struck high up on one of the wagons and been deflected down into the rifle pit. It was just an accident, they said, and that except for such accidents we were safe where we were.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">When I looked again, Silas Dunlap was dead, and I suffered distinct disappointment in being cheated out of witnessing that particular event. I had never been lucky enough to see a man actually die before my eyes.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">Dorothy Castleton got hysterics over what had happened, and yelled and screamed for a long time and she set Mrs. Hastings going again. Altogether, such a row was raised that father sent Watt Cummings crawling back to us to find out what was the matter.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">Well along into twilight the heavy firing ceased, although there were scattering shots during the night. Two of our men were wounded in this second attack, and were brought into the rifle pit.

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">All during the night men relieved one another at sinking the well deeper; but the only sign of water they got was damp sand. Some of the men fetched a few pails of water from the spring, but were fired upon, and they gave it up when Jeremy Hopkins had his left hand shot off at the wrist.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">Next morning, the third day, it was hotter and dryer than ever. We awoke thirsty, and there was no cooking. So dry were our mouths that we could not eat. I tried a piece of stale bread mother gave me, but had to give it up. The firing rose and fell. Sometimes there were hundreds shooting into the camp. At other times came lulls in

which not a shot was fired. Father was continually cautioning our men not to waste shots because we were running short of ammunition.</seg></p>

<p>And all the time the men went on digging the well. It was so deep that they were hoisting the sand up in buckets. The men who hoisted were exposed, and one of them  was wounded in the shoulder. He was Peter Bromley, who drove oxen for the Bloodgood wagon, and he was engaged to marry Jane Bloodgood. She jumped out of the rifle pit and ran right to him while the bullets were flying and led him back into shelter. About midday the well caved in, and there was lively work digging out the couple who were buried in the sand. Amos Wentworth did not come to for an hour. After that they timbered the well with bottom boards from the wagons and wagon tongues, and the digging went on. But all they would get, and they were twenty feet down, was damp sand. The water would not seep.</p>

<p>By this time the conditions in the rifle pit were terrible. The children were complaining for water, and the babies, hoarse from much crying, went on crying. Robert Carr, another wounded man, lay about ten feet from mother and me. He was out of his head, and kept thrashing his arms about and calling for water. And some of the women were almost as bad, and kept raving against the Mormons and Indians. Some of the women prayed a great deal, and the three grown Demdike sisters with their mother sang gospel hymns. Other women got damp sand that was hoisted out of the bottom of the well, and packed it against the bare bodies of the babies to try to cool and soothe them.</p>

<p>The two Fairfax brothers couldn't stand it any longer, and, with pails in their hands, crawled out under a wagon and made a dash for the spring. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">Giles never got half way, when he went down.</seg> Roger made it there and back

without being hit. He brought two pails part-full, for some splashed out when he ran. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">Giles crawled back, and when they helped him into the rifle pit he was bleeding at the mouth and coughing.</seg></p>

<p>Two part-pails of water could not go far among over a hundred of us, not counting the men. Only the babies, and the very little children, and the wounded men, got any. I did not get a sip, although mother dipped a bit of cloth into the several spoonfuls she got for the baby and wiped my mouth out. She did not even do that for herself, for she left me the bit of damp rag to chew.</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">The situation grew unspeakably worse in the afternoon. The quiet sun blazed down through the clear windless air and made a furnace of our hole in the sand. And all about us were the explosions of rifles and yells of <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">the Indians</seg>. Only once in a while did father permit a single shot from the trench, and at that, only by our best marksmen, such as Laban and Timothy Grant. But a steady stream of lead poured into our position all the time. There were no more disastrous ricochets, however; and our men in the trench, no longer firing, lay low and escaped damage. Only four were wounded, and only one of them very badly.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">Father came in from the trench during a lull in the firing. He sat for a few minutes alongside mother and me without speaking. He seemed to be listening to all the moaning and crying for water that was going up. Once, he climbed out of the rifle pit and went over to investigate the well. He brought back only damp sand, which he plastered thick on the chest and shoulders of Robert Carr. Then he went to where Jed Dunham and his mother were, and sent for Jed's father to come in from the trench. So closely packed were we, that when anybody moved about inside the rifle pit he had to crawl carefully over the bodies of those lying down.</seg></p>

<pb n="144" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.157"/>
                
<p>After a time, father came crawling back to us.</p>

<p>"Jesse," he asked, "are you afraid of <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">the Indians</seg>?"</p>

<p>I shook my head emphatically, guessing that I was to be sent on another proud mission.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">the damned Mormons</seg>?"</p>

<p>"Not of any damned Mormon," I answered, taking advantage of the opportunity to curse our enemies without fear of the avenging back of mother's hand.</p>

<p>I noted the little smile that curled his tired lips for the moment, when he heard my reply.</p>

<p>"Well, then, Jesse," he said, "will you go with Jed to the spring for water?"</p>

<p>I was all eagerness.</p>

<p>"We're going to dress the two of you up as girls," he continued, "so that maybe they won't fire on you."</p>

<p>I insisted on going as I was, as a male human that wore pants; but I surrendered quickly enough when father suggested that he would find some other boy to dress up and go along with Jed.</p>

<p>A chest was fetched in from the Chattox wagon. The Chattox girls were twins and of about a size with Jed and me. Several of the women got around to help. They were the Sunday dresses of the Chattox twins, and had come in the chest all the way from <placeName type="state" key="Arksansas">Arkansas</placeName>.</p>

<p>In her anxiety, mother left the baby with Sarah Dunlap, and came as far as the trench with me. There, under a wagon and behind the little breastwork of sand, Jed and I received our last instructions. Then we crawled out and stood up in the open. We were dressed precisely alike&#8212;white stockings, white dresses with big blue sashes, and white sunbonnets. Jed's right, and my left hand were clasped together. In each of our free hands we carried two small pails.</p>

<p>"Take it easy," father cautioned, as we began our advance. "Go slow. Walk like girls."</p>

<pb n="145" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.158"/>
                
<p>Not a shot was fired. We made the spring safely, filled our pails, and lay down and took a good drink ourselves. With a full pail in each hand we made the return trip. And still not a shot was fired.</p>

<p>I cannot remember how many journeys we made&#8212;fully fifteen or twenty. We walked slowly, always going out with hands clasped, always coming back slowly with four pails of water. It was astonishing how thirsty we were. We lay down several times and took long drinks.</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">But it was too much for our enemies. <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">I cannot imagine that the Indians would have withheld their fire for so long, girls or no girls, had they not obeyed instructions from the whites who were with them. At any rate, Jed and I were just starting on another trip when a rifle went off from the Indian hill, and then another.</seg></seg></p>

<p>"Come back!" mother cried out.</p>

<p>I looked at Jed, and found him looking at me. I knew he was stubborn and had made up his mind to be the last one in. So I started to advance, and at the same instant he started.</p>

<p>"You!&#8212;Jesse!" cried my mother. And there was more than a smacking in the way she said it.</p>

<p>Jed offered to clasp hands, but I shook my head.</p>

<p>"Run for it," I said.</p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">And while we hotfooted it across the sand, it seemed all the rifles on Indian hill were turned loose on us. I got to the spring a little ahead, so that Jed had to wait for me to fill my pails.</seg></seg></p>

<p>"Now run for it," he told me; and from the leisurely way he went about filling his own pails I knew he was determined to be in last.</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">So I crouched down, and, while I waited, watched the puffs of dust raised by the bullets. We began the return side by side and running.</seg></p>

<pb n="146" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.159"/>
                
<p>"Not so fast," I cautioned him, "or you'll spill half the water."</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">That stung him, and he slacked back perceptibly. Midway I stumbled and fell headlong. A bullet, striking directly in front of me, filled my eyes with sand. For the moment I thought I was shot.</seg></p>

<p>"Done it a-purpose," Jed sneered, as I scrambled to my feet. He had stood and waited for me.</p>

<p>I caught his idea. He thought I had fallen deliberately in order to spill my water and go back for more. This rivalry between us was a serious matter&#8212;so serious, indeed, that I immediately took advantage of what he had imputed and raced back to the spring. And Jed Dunham, scornful of the ballets that were puffing dust all around him, stood there upright in the open and waited for me. We came in side by side, with honors even in our boy's foolhardiness. But when we delivered the water, Jed had only one pailful. A bullet had gone through the other pail close to the bottom.</p>

<p>Mother took it out on me with a lecture on disobedience. She must have known, after what I had done, that father wouldn't let her smack me; for, while she was lecturing, father winked at me across her shoulder. It was the first time he had ever winked at me.</p>

<p>Back in the rifle pit Jed and I were heroes. The women wept and blessed us, and kissed us and mauled us. And I confess I was proud of the demonstration, although, like Jed, I let on that I did not like all such making-over. But Jeremy Hopkins, a great bandage about the stump of his left wrist, said we were the stuf white men were made out of&#8212;men like Daniel Boone, like Kit Carson and Davy Crockett. I was prouder of that than all the rest.</p>

<p>The remainder of the day I seem to have been bothered

<pb n="147" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.160"/>
                
principally with the pain of my right eye caused by the sand that had been kicked into it by the bullet. The eye was bloodshot, mother said; and to me it seemed to hurt just as much whether I kept it open or closed. I tried both ways.</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">Things were quieter in the rifle pit, because all had had water; though strong upon us was the problem of how the next water was to be procured. Coupled with this was the known fact that our ammunition was almost exhausted. A thorough overhauling of the wagons by father had resulted in finding five pounds of powder. A very little more was in the flasks of the men.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">I remembered the sundown attack of the night before, and anticipated it this time by crawling to the trench before sunset. I crept into a place alongside of Laban. He was busy chewing tobacco, and did not notice me. For some time I watched him, fearing that when he discovered me he would order me back. He would take a long squint out between the wagon wheels, chew steadily a while, and then spit carefully into a little depression he had made in the sand.</seg></p>

<p>"How's tricks?" I asked finally. It was the way he always addressed me.</p>

<p>"Fine," he answered. "Most remarkable fine, Jesse, now that I can chew again. My mouth was that dry that I couldn't chew from sun-up to when you brung the water."</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">Here, a man showed head and shoulders over the top of the little hill to the northeast occupied by the whites. Laban sighted his rifle on him for a long minute. Then he shook his head.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">"Four hundred yards. Nope, I don't risk it. I might get him, and then again I mightn't, an' your dad is mighty anxious about the powder."</seg></p>

<p>Nothing happened all morning. Not a shot was fired. Only the sun blazed down through the quiet air. Our thirst grew, and soon the babies were crying and the younger children whimpering and complaining. At noon, Will Hamilton took two large pails and started for the spring. But before he could crawl under the wagon, Ann Demdike ran and got her arms around him and tried to hold him back. But he talked to her, and kissed her, and went on. Not a shot was fired, nor was any fired all the time he continued to go out and bring back water.</p>

<p>"Praise God!" cried old Mrs. Demdike. "It is a sign. They have relented."</p>

<p>This was the opinion of many of the women.</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">About two o'clock, after we had eaten and felt better, a white man appeared, carrying a white flag. Will Hamilton went out and talked to him, came back and talked with father and the rest of our men, and then went out to the stranger again. Farther back we could see a man standing and looking on whom we recognized as <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName>.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">With us, all was excitement. The women were so relieved that they were crying and kissing one another, and old Mrs. Demdike and others were hallelujahing and blessing God. The proposal, which our men had accepted, was that we would put ourselves under the flag of truce and <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">be protected from the Indians</seg>.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">"We had to do it," I heard father tell mother.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">He was sitting, droop-shouldered and dejected, on a wagon tongue.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">"But what if they intend treachery?" mother asked. He shrugged his shoulders.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">"We've got to take the chance that they don't," he said.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">"Our ammunition is gone."</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">Some of our men were unchaining one of our wagons and rolling it out of the way. I ran across to see what was

<pb n="151" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.162"/>
                
happening. In came <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> himself, followed by two empty wagons, each driven by one man. Everybody crowded around <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName>. <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">He said that they had had a hard time with the Indians keeping them off of us</seg>, and that Major <persName key="Higbee, Isaac C.">Higbee</persName> with fifty of the Mormon militia were ready to take us under their charge.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence"><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">But what made father and Laban and some of the men suspicious was when <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> said that we must put all our rifles into one of the wagons so as not to arouse the animosity of <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">the Indians</seg>. By so doing we would appear to be the prisoners of the Mormon militia.</seg></seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">Father straightened up and was about to refuse, when he glanced to Laban, who replied in an undertone:</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">"They ain't no more use in our hands than in the wagon, seein' as the powder's gone."</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">Two of our wounded men who could not walk, were put into the wagons, and along with them were put all the little children. <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> seemed to be picking them out over eight and under eight. Jed and I were large for our age, and we were nine besides; so <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> put us with the older bunch and told us we were to march with the women on foot.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">When he took our baby from mother and put it in a wagon, she started to object. Then I saw her lips draw tightly together, and she gave in. She was a gray-eyed, strong-featured, middle-aged woman, large-boned and fairly stout. But the long journey and hardship had told on her, so that she was hollow-cheeked and gaunt, and like all the women in the company she wore an expression of brooding, never-ceasing anxiety.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">It was when <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> described the order of march that Laban came to me. <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> said that the women and the children that walked should go first in the line, following behind the two wagons. Then the men, in single file, should follow the women. When Laban heard this, he

<pb n="152" xml:id="mmm.fiction.london.1915.163"/>
                
came to me, untied the scalps from his belt, and fastened them to my waist.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">"But you ain't killed yet," I protested.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">"You bet your life I ain't," he answered lightly. "I've just reformed, that's all. This scalp-wearin' is a vain thing and heathen." He stopped a moment as if he had forgotten something, then, as he turned abruptly on his heel to regain the men of our company, he called over his shoulder, "Well, so long, Jesse."</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence"><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">I was wondering why he should say good-bye, when a white man came riding into the corral. He said Major <persName key="Higbee, Isaac C.">Higbee</persName> had sent him to tell us to hurry up, because <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">the Indians might attack at any moment</seg>.</seg></seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">So the march began, the two wagons first. <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> kept along with the women and walking children. Behind us, after waiting until we were a couple of hundred feet in advance, came our men. As we emerged from the corral we could see the militia just a short distance away. They were leaning on their rifles and standing in a long line about six feet apart. As we passed them, I could not help noticing how solemn-faced they were. They looked like men at a funeral. So did the women notice this, and some of them began to cry.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender"><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">I walked right behind my mother. I had chosen this position so that she would not catch sight of my scalps. Behind me came the three Demdike sisters, two of them helping the old mother. I could hear <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> calling all the time to the men who drove the wagons not to go so fast. A man that one of the Demdike girls said must be Major <persName key="Higbee, Isaac C.">Higbee</persName>, sat on a horse watching us go by. Not an Indian was in sight.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">By the time our men were just abreast of the militia&#8212;I had just looked back to try to see where Jed Dunham was&#8212;the thing happened. I heard Major <persName key="Higbee, Isaac C.">Higbee</persName> cry out as a loud voice, "Do your duty!" All the rifles of

the militia seemed to go off at once, and <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">our men were falling over and sinking down. All the Demdike women went down at one time. I turned quickly to see how mother was, and she was down. <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">Right alongside of us, out of the bushes, came hundreds of Indians, all shooting. I saw the two Dunlap sisters start on the run across the sand, and took after them, for whites and Indians were all killing us.</seg> And as I ran, I saw the driver of one of the wagons shooting the two wounded men.</seg> The horses of the other wagon were plunging and rearing and their driver was trying to hold them.</seg></p>
