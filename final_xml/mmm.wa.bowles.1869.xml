<!-- Section Not Direclty Relevant to the Mountain Meadows Massacre:

<p>Of course we had a good deal of curiosity, while in
Utah, to study the persons and characters of the
Mormon leaders and the operation of polygamy; and
though one avenue to information was largely denied
us, every other was freely open, and the lacking
in that was measurably made up to us by plenty of
second&#8211;hand testimony from and about the fractional
wives of the saints. When we arrived, Brigham
Young was away from the city; but he soon came
back in grand state, for he travels among his subjects
like an oriental prince, with procession of carriages
and men on horseback. He takes with him always
two personal servants, one a barber, and the other

one of his wives. Directly he came, with half a
dozen of his Apostles, to pay his respects to Mr.
Colfax,&#8212;for the Speaker had given out that he
should observe Washington etiquette, and not call
first on him, which pleased the Gentiles,&#8212;and they
spent most of a morning with us. We had free and
familiar talk of the Territory and its industries, of
the scenery, of irrigation, of the Indians, of everything 
but the one theme upon which both sides were
the most eager to compare notes. Young explained
to me the Mormon policy as to the Indians; in brief,
it was that they had found it cheaper and easier to
feed them than to fight them. But, he said, they
could not last long; the food and the diseases of civilization
are killing them off; even white bread, of
which they are very fond, weakens and destroys their
constitutions. And he told of an Indian boy, whom
he took into his family, robust and healthy, but,
though he fared as well as his own children, he soon
sickened and died.</p>

<p>Brigham Young is a well-preserved, good-looking
man of now near seventy years; stout, smooth&#8211;faced,
self&#8211;controlled; slow and careful of speech; with a
light gray eye, cold and uncertain; a thin, short under-lip 
and chin, betraying great power of will, and
which shrank and curled and quivered under feeling
with a most devilish ugliness. That lip and that
chin were the only indexes to his character, as exhibited in 
his life, that I could find either in his face
or manner; but they showed that he would allow
nothing to stand in the way of his purposes. There
was not the faintest sign of rashness or weakness, but

<pb n="236" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.249"/>

abundant token of the spirit that would send and has
sent men to a sudden grave, in the most cool and
relentless manner, for resisting his authority or standing in 
the way of his purposes. He is physically a
handsome man, and takes great pains with his dress;
but he was to me repellant in personal atmosphere.
In conversation, he is cool, quiet, but intelligent and
suggestive, has strong, original ideas, but conveys
them with rather coarse and ungrammatical language.
He was somewhat formal, but courteous, and at the
last affected frankness and freedom, if he felt it not;
and when his eye did sparkle and his lips soften, it
was with most cheering, though not warming, effect;
it was pleasant but did not melt you.</p>

<p>Heber C. Kimball ranked next to Young in church
and state, when we were there, and was accounted by
the Mormons to hold the gift of prophecy in even
more divine degree than his leader. But he seemed
to us, from all we saw and heard of him, a blessed old
rascal; unctuous in looks and manners as Macassar
hair oil, and pious in phrase as good old Thomas &#224;
Kempis; but a consummate hypocrite, hard and tricky
at a bargain in worldly matters, and tyrannical to his
long retinue of sorry-looking wives, the happiest day
of whose lives was that of his death. His office
appeared to be that of keeper of the seals of Heaven,
and the fulminator of the Divine wrath or the dispenser 
of the Divine grace, and he distributed both
about with equal vulgarity and repulsiveness.</p>

<p>George A. Smith is another of the head Apostles,
and succeeded Kimball as Vice-President. He is one
of the oldest and most faithful Mormons, very intelligent

 <pb n="237" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.250"/>                   

in their history, and a heavy, full-orbed man,
with solid qualities of body and mind, who contents
himself with five wives. Two of the Apostles, Amasa
Lyman and Franklin Richards, are Massachusetts
men; several others are Englishmen, who are now
creeping into place and power in the church; and
they all average four wives each. Perhaps the most
refined man of our hosts in personal appearance and
manners was a Mr. Felt, originally from Salem, Mass.;
he lived in a very neat two-story cottage, embowered
with trees, and with two or three suggestive front
doors. But the American proportion, both of leaders
and followers, is fast decreasing. Brigham Young
himself says that fifteen out of every twenty of the
original American Mormons have apostatized; and
Apostle Smith says five out of six.</p>

<p>Two or three of the party who called on us had
fine faces,&#8212;such as you would meet in intellectual
or business society in Boston or New York,&#8212;but the
strength of most of them seemed to lie in narrowness,
bigotry, obstinacy. They looked as if they had lived
on the same farms as their fathers and grandfathers,
and made no improvements; gone to the same church, and sat 
in the same pews, without cushions; borrowed the same weekly
newspaper for forty years; drove all their children to the
West or the cities; and if they went to agricultural fairs, 
insisted on having their premiums in pure coin.</p>

<p>When we came to return their call, and met at
Brigham Young&#8217;s office pretty nearly the same
company of prominent Mormons, there was a full hour&#8217;s
frank talk of the whole matter of polygamy. He

<pb n="238" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.251"/>

had, just before we entered, been bothered by a man
who could not keep his <q>"women"</q> straight, and either
wanted a reinforcement of authority from head-quarters, or 
liberty to take an additional wife by way of
equalizing the contending forces; and it was not long
after we were seated ere he blurted out the blunt
question to Mr. Colfax&#8212;<q>" Well, now you have conquered 
the South and abolished slavery, what are
you going to do with us and our polygamy?”</q> With
his usual tact, Mr Colfax replied that he had no authority 
to speak for the government; but for himself,
if he might be permitted to make the suggestion, he
had hoped the prophets of the church would have a
new revelation on the subject, which should put a
stop to the practice of polygamy. He added further
that, as the people of Missouri and Maryland, without
waiting for the action of the general government
against slavery, themselves believing it to be wrong
and an impediment to their prosperity, had taken
measures to abolish it, so he hoped the people of the
Mormon church would see that polygamy was a hindrance 
and not a help, and move for its abandonment. Mr. Young responded 
quickly and frankly, and apparently as much to the surprise 
of his friends as to our own, that he should readily welcome such a
revelation; that polygamy was not in the original
book of the Mormons; that it was not an essential
practice in the church, but only a privilege and a
duty, under special command of God; that he knew
it had been abused; that people had entered into
polygamy who ought not to have done so, and
against his protestation and advice; and that wives

<pb n="239" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.252"/>                   

and husbands, in polygamy, were constantly fretting
him with their troubles. At the same time, he defended the practice as having biblical authority, and
as having, within proper limits, a sound, moral and
philosophical reason and propriety.</p>

<p>The discussion, thus opened, grew general and
sharp, though ever good-natured. Mr. Young was
asked how he got over the fact that the two sexes
were about equally divided all over the world, and
that if some men had two, five, or twenty wives,
others would have to go without altogether. His
reply was that there was always a considerable 
proportion of the men who would never marry, who were
old bachelors from choice. But, retorted one, are
there any more of such than of women who choose to
be old maids? Oh yes, said he, most ungallantly;
there is not one woman in a million who will not
marry if she gets a chance! Mr. G. Q. Cannon, an
Englishman, and probably the most learned of the
Apostles, strongly pressed the biblical usage and 
authority for many wives, as above all laws and constitutions, 
but was asked as to the effect of the same
usage and authority for human sacrifce,&#8212;would you,
for instance, if commanded by God, offer up your
son or your enemy as a sacrifice, killing them? Yes,
he promptly replied. Then the civil law would lay
its hands upon you and stop you, and would be justified in 
doing so, was the apparently effective answer.</p>

<p>In the course of the discussion, Mr. Young asked,
Suppose polygamy is given up, will not your government 
then demand more,&#8212;will it not war upon the
Book of the Mormons, and attack our church <choice><orig>organ-
                    
<pb n="240" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.253"/>
                    
ization</orig><reg>organization</reg></choice>? The reply was, emphatically, No, that it had no right, 
and could have no justification in doing so, and that we had 
no idea there would be any disposition in that direction. 
The Mormons would then take rank and take their chances with the other
Protestant denominations,&#8212;the Methodists, Baptists
and Episcopalians,&#8212;and all would be left free to
work and quarrel together on the same platform of
equal rights.</p>

<p>The talk, which was said to be the freest and
frankest ever known on that subject in that presence, 
ended pleasantly, but with the full expression,
on the part of Mr. Colfax and his friends, of their
hope that the polygamy question might be removed
from existence, and thus all objection to the admission 
of Utah as a State be taken away; but that, until
it was, no such admission was possible, and that the
government could not continue to look indifferently
upon the enlargement of so offensive a practice. And
not only what Mr. Young said, but his whole manner
left with us the impression that, if public opinion and
the government united vigorously, but at the same
time discreetly, to press the question, there would be
found some way to acquiesce in the demand, and
change the practice of the present fathers of the
church.</p>

<p>But this indication of a change of base was not well
received by the Mormon leaders generally. They protested
against it, and very soon after we left, it was
disowned or explained away, and polygamy took a
fresh start. There has seemed, indeed, to be an effort
to extend its complications and influences, and get

-->

<!--

everybody into it of any character or power in the
church or in society. When we were there, it was
estimated that not more than one in six or eight of
the men had embraced the practice; but since, it has
increased from fifty to one hundred per cent, and one
in three or four of the men have more than one wife
each. So the evil has grown to formidable proportions, 
and its eradication, even its limitation, seems
much harder to compass than it did in 1865.</p>

End of Section Not Relevant to Mountain Meadows Massacre -->

<p>Our afternoon&#8217;s talk with <persName key="Young, Brigham">Young</persName> and his associates included the proper way of treating the leading rebels
and the merits of slavery in the abstract. He boldly
espoused slavery <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> as established by Divine
authority, like polygamy, but denounced the chattel
system of the South; and he opposed the hanging of
any of the rebel chiefs as an unwise and aggravating
policy. Now that peace is established, let all be pardoned, 
he said; but early in or during the war, he
would have disposed of the rebel chiefs that fell into
the hands of the government without mercy or hesitation. 
Had he been President when Mason and Slidell were captured, 
he would have speedily put them <q>"<hi rend="italic">where 
they never would peep,</hi>"</q> and negotiated with England 
afterwards. As he said this, the thin lip shortened and the
lower jaw worked, most diabolically; and I felt sure he could 
be as good as his word, and no longer doubted where the inspiration 
for the Mountain Meadow massacres, the slaughter of the recusant 
Josephites, or the various assassinations by the <q>"Danites"</q> 
of individual rebels from the church or uncompromising Gentiles, came from.
Young thoroughly believes in punishing his enemies

<pb n="242" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.255"/>

with fire and sword, and all in the name of the Lord
his God. He is a resolute and literal Old Testament
Christian in theory and practice,&#8212;thus far at least.</p>

<!-- Not Relevant to Mountain Meadows Massacre:

<p>On both Sabbaths we attended the Mormon religious
services in the Church square. Meetings are held
every Sunday, also, and on some week-day nights, in
the church edifices in each of the twenty wards of
the city, where the local bishops and elders drill the
people in all the duties of life, instructing them with
a plainness and with an autocratic authority as to
their entire line of thinking and acting, that any
other Protestant people or even any American Catholics
would resent with indignation. But their ignorant, fanatical 
followers seem to take it all as law and gospel, and are 
under such strict surveillance and authority that most of 
them would not even dare to disobey or protest. At the 
Tabernacle building, the gathering is from the whole city, 
amounting commonly to several thousands, and the services 
are conducted by some of the Apostles. The congregations
are naturally not of a very high grade, either of physical 
beauty or mental capacity,&#8212;they were as dreadfully 
commonplace as you can imagine the refuse of
the English factory towns, with a sprinkling of the
peasantries of Germany, Finland, Sweden, Scotland,
Norway, even Iceland, would be. Yet they exhibited
improvement over their probable former life in tidiness of 
dress and better living. But the small narrow heads told of 
limited brains and shallow thought. The handsome girls were few;
 the fine-looking women even fewer; intelligent, strong-headed men were more
numerous; but the great mass, alike in size, looks and

<pb n="243" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.256"/>

dress, were below the poorest, hardest-working and
most ignorant classes of our eastern large towns.</p>

<p>The gatherings and the services, both in speaking
and singing, reminded me of the Methodist camp-meetings 
of fifteen or twenty years ago. The singing, as on the 
latter occasions, was the best part of
the exercises, simple, sweet, and fervent. <q>"Daughters of 
Zion,"</q> as sung by the large choir one Sunday
morning, was prayer, sermon, song and all. The
preacher that day was Apostle Richards, but beyond
setting forth the superiority of the Mormon church
system, through its presidents, councils, bishops, elders
and seventies, for the work made incumbent upon
Christians, and claiming that its preachers were inspired
like those of old, his discourse was a rambling, unimpressive 
exhortation, such as you may have
heard from a tonguey deacon in any country Baptist
or Methodist meeting-house of the last generation.
The Bible, both Old and New Testaments, is used
with the same authority as by all Protestants; the
Mormon Scriptures are simply new and added books,
confirming and supplementing the teachings of the
original Scriptures. The rite of the sacrament is administered every Sunday, water being used instead
of wine, and the distribution proceeding among the
whole congregation, men, women and children, and
numbering from three to five thousand, while the
singing and the preaching are in progress. The
prayers are few and simple, undistinguishable, except
in these characteristics, from those heard in all Protestant churches, and the congregation all join in the Amen.</p>

<pb n="244" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.257"/>

<p>The next Sunday, especially for our edification,
Brigham Young himself preached; but he was very
unsatisfactory and disappointing in his effort. There
was every incentive for him to do his best; he had an
audience of four or five thousands spread out under the
<q>"Bowery,"</q> adjoining the Tabernacle, where the summer
meetings are held; before him was Mr. Colfax, who had
asked him to preach upon the distinctive Mormon doctrines; 
around him were all his elders and bishops, in
unusual numbers; and he was fresh from the exciting
discussion of the day before on the subject of polygamy. 
But his address lacked logic, lacked effect, lacked
wholly magnetism or impressiveness. It was a curious medley 
of scriptural exposition and exhortation,
bold and bare statement, coarse denunciation and vulgar 
allusion, cheap rant and poor cant. So far as his
statement of Mormon belief went, it amounted to this:
that God was a human, material person, with like flesh
and blood and passions to ourselves, only perfect in all
things; that he begot his son Jesus in the same way
that children are begotten now; that Jesus and the
Father looked alike and were alike, distinguishable
only by the former being older; that our resurrection
would be material, and we should live in heaven with
the same bodies and the same passions as on earth;
that Mormonism was the most perfect and true religion; 
that those Christians who were not Mormons
would not necessarily go to hell and be burned by
living fire and tortured by ugly devils, but that they
would not occupy so high places in heaven as the
Latter Day Saints; that polygamy was the habit of
all the children of God in the earlier ages, and was

<pb n="245" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.258"/>

first abolished by the Goths and Vandals who conquered and 
reconstructed Rome; that Martin Luther approved of it in a 
single case at least; that a clergyman of the Church of England
once married a man to a second wife while his first wife was living;
and that in England now, if a man wanted to change his
wife, he had only to offer her at auction and knock
her off for a pot of beer or a shilling, and marry another. 
A good deal of boasting of the success of the
Mormons, their temperance, frugality and honesty,
and a sharp denunciation of the <q>"few stinking lawyers who 
lived down in Whiskey street, and for five
dollars would attempt to make a lie into a truth,"</q>
were the only other noticeable features of this discourse 
of the President of the Church of the Latter
Day Saints. It was a very material interpretation of
the statements and truths of Scripture, very illogically 
and roughly rendered; and calculated only to
influence a cheap and vulgar audience. Brigham
Young may be a shrewd business man, an able organizer of labor,
a bold, brave person in dealing with
the practicalities of life,&#8212;he must, indeed, be all of
these, for we see the evidences all around this city
and country; but he is in no sense an impressive or
effective preacher, judged by any standards that I
have been accustomed to.</p>

<p>A good many Mormon sermons have been reported
and published, some by themselves, others by Gentile
listeners. Their language in many instances is shockingly 
blasphemous; in others, where rebellious or vain or wicked 
women are denounced, or the young girls are instructed in 
their duty to become <choice><orig>con-
                    
<pb n="246" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.259"/>
                    
cubines</orig><reg>concubines</reg></choice> and bear children as soon as the laws of nature will permit, 
it is positively filthy and disgusting, such as would not be 
tolerated elsewhere out of the vilest dens of great cities. 
As specimens, not of such sermons, but of the more decent sort,
I quote a few independent sentences,&#8212;they are from Brigham
Young, and Apostles Smith and Pratt:&#8212;</p>

<p><q>" When a man comes right out like an independent devil, and says
'D&#8212; Mormonism and all the Mormons,&#8217; and is off with himself to
California, I say he is a gentleman by the side of a nasty, sneaking
apostate, who is opposed to nothing but Christianity. But now, you
Gladdenites [a band of recusant Mormons,] keep your tongues still,
lest sudden destruction come upon you. I say, rather than that apostates 
should flourish here, I will unsheath my bowie-knife and conquer or die.”</q></p>

<p><q>" There are sins that men commit for which they cannot receive 
forgiveness in this world, or in that which is to come; and if they had
their eyes open to see their true condition they would be perfectly 
willing to have their blood spilt, that the smoke thereof might ascend to
heaven as an ofering for their sins, and the incense would atone for
their sins. I know when you hear my brethren telling about cutting
people of from the earth that you consider it strong doctrine; 
<hi rend="italic">but it is to save them, not to destroy them.</hi> 
It is true that the blood of the Son of God was shed for sins through 
the fall and those committed by men, yet men can commit sin which it 
never can remit. There are sins which can be atoned for by an offering 
upon an altar as in ancient days, but there are also sins which the blood 
of a lamb, of a calf, or of turtle doves cannot remit; 
<hi rend="italic">but they must be atoned for by the blood of the man</hi>."</q></p>

<p><q>" No wonder that you grope in the dark; that you are subject to
doubts and fears concerning your eternal salvation. The law of celestial 
marriage is right, but you will not obey it, and those of you who
do not accept the Gospel of Christ can expect nothing but darkness.
There is no inducement for any man to become a Latter Day Saint
unless he accepts the Spirit of God in his heart and obeys His teachings."</q></p>

<p><q>"If an elder has borrowed from you, and you find he is going to
apostatize, then you may tighten the screws upon him; but if he is

<pb n="247" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.260"/>

willing to preach the Gospel without purse or scrip, it is none of your
business what he has done with the money he has borrowed from you.
If you murmur against that elder, it will prove your damnation! No
man need judge me. You know nothing about it, whether I am sent
or not; furthermore it is none of your business, only to listen with open
ears to what is taught you and serve God with an undivided heart."</q></p>

<p><q>"How was it with Mary and Martha, and other women who followed
Jesus? In old times, and it is common in this day, the women, even
Sarah, called their husbands lord. The word is tantamount to husband
in some languages. Master, lord and husband are synonymous. When
Mary came to the sepulchre, Jesus said unto her, Mary! She said
unto him, Rabboni, which is to say master. Is there not here manifested 
the affection of a wife? These words were the kindred ties and
sympathies that are common between husband and wife."</q> The same
discourse declared that Jesus was himself the bridegroom at the marriage 
in Cana of Galilee, and that Mary and Martha were both his wives!</p>

<p>These are fair illustrations of the intellectual and
religious husks on which these poor people are fed
from Sunday to Sunday. Perhaps they are above
the average in propriety and piety of expression; but
they show, better than any characterization of mine,
the spirit both of priests and people; how brutal is
that of the one, how debased that of the other.</p>

<p>Mr. Colfax&#8217;s presence in their pulpit was certainly
a novelty for the Mormon audience. On the Sunday
evening after Brigham Young&#8217;s sermon, he repeated
there, by request, his eulogy on the life and principles
of President Lincoln, then a fresh theme everywhere
in our broad land. The audience was swollen to five
or six thousands; and, dull of comprehension and
fanatically devoted to Young and his Apostles as most
of them were, they could not have failed to feel that
they were listening to a higher order of eloquence

<pb n="248" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.261"/>

and patriotism,&#8212;to nobler thoughts in nobler garb,&#8212;
than those which were usually doled out to them. At
least they listened with rapt attention and apparent
sympathy; and it is rare that they hear so lofty and
loyal sentiments from that platform. The Mormon
preachers never allude to the national government
but to criticise, belittle and abuse.</p>

<p>But of polygamy in practice? How does it operate?&#8212;
what are its results?&#8212;what its prospects?
Most obviously, first, there are plenty of children.
The houses and yards and streets swarm with them.
The Divine injunction to increase and multiply, that
they may people the earth, is held in great respect
by the Mormon patriarchs. They quote it often in
defense to Gentile doubters, or as injunction to hesitating 
believers, men or women, who fear to launch away on the sea 
of polygamy. The care of the children is obviously not of 
the best; it would not be strange if many of them were not wise enough to
know their own fathers; but this is not the worst
form of their ignorance. There are fathers who are
loyal, there are mothers who are tender, of course, even
the more tender because of their own sufferings, and
the church exhorts and enforces a certain degree of
care and instruction; but the general life of the
Mormons is simple, material and hard; there is not
only little unity in polygamous families, but a good
deal of discord, and the children cannot avoid suffering, 
not only from neglect and from the general debasement 
and materiality of life, but sharply and especially from the 
inevitable revenge that outraged nature, unelevated and undisciplined by <choice><orig>cul-
                    
<pb n="249" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.262"/>
                    
ture</orig><reg>culture</reg></choice>, is forever certain to wreak on those nearest
and even dearest to it.</p>

<p>Their religion is of course the great reason for
polygamy; it is the excuse of the men; it is the 
reconciliation of the women. Many, perhaps most of
both sexes really believe in it as a religious duty;
but I find this part of their religion is much easier
and more acceptable to the men than to the women.
The former go to the sacrifice with a certain brutal
joy; the latter with a hard, sad resignation. When
men talk with men, as men, the truth cannot help
but crop out as to such a matter as this; and the
chances are two to one, that before you get through
discussing polygamy with a many-wived Mormon, he
will commend it, with a lustful leer, to the master-passion 
of the sex. But with the women, ignorant and degraded as 
most of them are, the universal testimony of all but their 
husbands is, that it is a grievous sorrow and burden; 
only cheerfully submitted to and
embraced under a religious fanaticism and self-abnegation 
rare to behold, and possible only to women.
They are taught to believe, and many of them really
do believe, that through and by it they secure a
higher and more glorious reward in the future world.
<q>"Lord Jesus has laid a heavy trial upon me,"</q> said one
poor, sweet woman, <q>"but I mean to bear it for His
sake, and for the glory He will grant me in His kingdom."</q> 
This is the common wail, the common solace.</p>

<p>In some cases the common wives live harmoniously
and lovingly together; oftener, it would seem, they
have separate parts of the same house, or even separate houses. 
The first wife is generally the <choice><orig>recog-

<pb n="250" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.263"/>

nized</orig><reg>recognized</reg></choice> one of general, especially of Gentile society, and frequently 
assumes contempt for the others, regarding them as concubines, 
and not wives. But it is a dreadful state of society to any one 
of fine feelings and true instincts; it robs married life of all its
sweet sentiment and companionship; and while it
degrades woman, it brutalizes man, teaching him to
despise and domineer over his wives, over all women.
It breeds jealousy, distrust, and tempts to infidelity;
but the police system of the church and the community is so 
strict and constant that it is claimed and
believed the latter vice is very rare. As I have said,
we had little direct communication with the women of
the Saints; but their testimony came to us in a hundred 
ways, sad, tragic, heart-rending. One woman,
an educated, handsome person, as yet a single wife,
said, with bated breath and almost hissing fury, to
one of our party, in some aside discussion of the subject,&#8212;
<q>" Polygamy is tolerable enough for the men,
but it is hell for the women."</q> Poor creature, she has
now bitterly realized in her own what she then saw
in other lives, for her brute of a husband has since
had <q>" sealed "</q> to himself, not only for eternity but for
earth, two or three young and fresh girls.</p>

<p>The only half wives we saw intimately were two
young Englishwomen, of nearly equal years; they
appeared together in the parlor and in public with
their husband, and dressed alike; but they had the
same quiet, subdued, half-sad air that characterized
all the Mormon women, young and old, that I saw
in public or private. There is certainly none of that
<q>"loudness"</q> about the Mormon ladies that an 
<choice><orig>East-

<pb n="251" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.264"/>

ern</orig><reg>Eastern</reg></choice> man cannot help observing in the manners of our
Western women generally. And I hardly think the
difference is to be attributed to the superior refinement
and culture of the sisters of the Salt Lake
Basin; it rather and really is the sign and mark of
their servitude, their debasement. Indeed, we have
the frequent testimony of the husbands, and even of
Brigham Young himself; to the irreconciliation of
wives with the polygamous state. Said Young in a
public sermon: <q>"It frequently happens that women
will say they are unhappy; and husbands testify that
&#8216;my wife, though a most excellent woman, has not
seen a happy day since I took my second wife.&#8217;"</q>
And then he proceeded to scold them for their rebellious feelings, and to enjoin upon them the Divine
duty of sweet submission!</p>

<p>The first generation of Mormon-born girls and boys
is just now coming to maturity. Despite their education 
they are not very eager to embrace the Divine
institution. But it is hard to escape its meshes.
Some of the girls have bolted and married Gentiles;
but more have been gobbled up as fresh victims for
the middle-aged and old men of the church. The
elders preach submission to this to the girls with 
sanctimonious solemnity as a Christian duty, and then
make haste to take advantage of the conviction they
have gained. Two unmarried Mormon young men
stated the case very humanly when they said: <q>"This
polygamy would be all right, only the women, you
know, &#8216; pull hair &#8217; so like darnation!"</q></p>

<p>Polygamy introduces many curious cross-relationships, 
and intertwines the branches of the genealogical

<pb n="252" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.265"/>

tree in a manner greatly to puzzle a mathematician,
as well as to disgust the decent-minded. The marrying of 
two or more sisters is very common; one young
Mormon merchant in Salt Lake City has three sisters
for his three wives. There are several cases of men
marrying both mother (widow) and her daughter or
daughters; taking the <q>"old woman"</q> for the sake of
getting the young ones; but having children by all.
Please to cipher out for yourselves how this mixes
things. Consider, too, how these children of one
father and many mothers,&#8212;the latter often blood
relations,&#8212;are likely to become crossed again in new
marriages, in the second or third, if not the first,
generations, under the operations of this polygamous
practice; and it is safe to predict that a few generations 
of such social practices will breed a physical,
moral and mental debasement of the people most
frightful to contemplate. Already, indeed, are such
indications apparent, foreshadowing the sure and terrible realization.</p>

<p>In many cases, the Mormon wives not only support
themselves and their children, but help support their
husbands. Thus a clerk or other man, with similar
limited income, who has yielded to the fascinations
and desires of three or four women, and married them
all, makes his home with number one, perhaps, and
the rest live apart, each by herself, taking in sewing
or washing, or engaging in other employment, to
keep up her establishment and be no charge to her
husband. He comes around, once in a while, to
make her a visit, and then she sets out an extra
table and spends all her accumulated earnings to

<pb n="253" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.266"/>

make him as comfortable and herself as charming
as possible, so that her fraction of the dear sainted
man may be multiplied as much as may be. Thus
the fellow, if he is lazy and has turned his piety to
the good account of getting smart wives, may really
board around continually, and live in clover, at no
personal expense but his own clothing. Is not this a
divine institution, indeed!</p>

<p>Brigham Young&#8217;s wives are numberless; at least
no one seems to know how many he has; and he has
himself confessed to forgetfulness in the matter. The
probability is he has from sixteen to twenty genuine
or complete wives, and about as many more women
<q>"sealed"</q> to him for heavenly association and glory.
The latter are mostly pious old ladies, eager for high
seats in the Mormon heaven, and knowing no surer
way to get there than to be joined on to Brigham&#8217;s
angelic procession. Some of these sealed wives of
his are the earthly wives of other men; but, lacking
faith in their husbands&#8217; heavenly glory, seek to make
a sure thing of it for the future by the grace of gracious Brigham.
Down East, you know, many a huband calculates on stealing into heaven under the
pious petticoats of his better wife; here the thing is
reversed, and women go to heaven because their
husbands take them along. The Mormon religion is
an excellent institution for maintaining masculine
authority in the family; and the greatness of a true
Mormon is measured, indeed, by the number of wives
he can keep in sweet and, loving and especially obedient 
subjugation. Such a man can have as many
wives as he wants. But President Young objects

<pb n="254" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.267"/>

to multiplying wives for men who have not this rare
domestic gift; and he finds great annoyance in being
teased by men, unfit to drive double teams of women,
to let them try their hands.</p>

<p>Brigham Young has in all some sixty or seventy
children; the younger ones, as seen in his school, to
which we were admitted, looked sprightly and bright
and handsome; and some of his grown up daughters
are comely and clever; but his older sons give no
marked sign of their father&#8217;s smartness. Brigham,
Jr., and Joseph A. have set up as polygamists and
prophets for themselves. They are big and burly
fellows; Brigham has shown some business capacity,
and has been a good deal of the time for years in
England and New York, forwarding the emigration
of the church; but the accomplishments of the other
are summed up as smoking good cigars, drinking
good liquors, playing poker, licking his wives, and
preaching the Mormon Gospel. It cannot be said,
surely, that he does not practice what he preaches.</p>

<p>The grand Head of the Church manages his household
on strict business principles. A son-in-law acts
as commissary; the wives have nothing to do with
the table or its supply; and whenever they want
new clothes or pocket-money, they must go to this
chief of staff or head of the family bureau. He does
not allow any of them to come begging or whining
about him for any cause,&#8212;when he wants one, he
sends for her. And the rule for children, <q>"Speak
when you are spoken to, and not otherwise,"</q> is the
law of his domestic economy. Considering his opportunities,
he seems to have made a rather 
sorry <choice><orig>selec-

<pb n="255" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.268"/>
                    
tion</orig><reg>selection</reg></choice> of women on the score of beauty. The oldest
or first is a matronly-looking old lady, serene and
sober; the youngest and present pet, who was obtained, 
they say, after much seeking, is comely but
common-looking, despite the extra millinery in which
she alone of the entire family indulges; while all between are very  
<q>"or&#8217;nary"</q> indeed. Handsome women
and girls, in fact, are scarce among the Mormons of
Salt Lake,&#8212;the fewer Gentiles can show many
more of them. Why is this? Is beauty more esthetic and ascetic? Or, good-looking women being
supposed to have more chances for matrimony than
their plainer sisters, do they all insist upon having
the whole of one man, and leave the Mormon husbands to those whose choice is like Hobson&#8217;s?</p>

<p>The following list and description of Brigham
Young&#8217;s family, made up from various sources by
Mr. Coffin of Boston, who visited Salt Lake City in
1868, agree substantially with the information we
obtained concerning them during our earlier visit.
The extract will help my readers to a personal 
appreciation of the fact and operation of polygamy; but
it is an institution, after all, whose realities neither
description nor imagination can fairly set before the
mind:&#8212;</p>

<p><q>"This is the harem. A covered passage leads from the ground floor
to another building East in which is the general business office of
Young, and from which telegraph wires run to every hamlet
in the Territory. Another passage leads to the private office of Brigham
&#8212;back of which is his private bedroom, where his concubines wait
upon him,&#8212;Amelia to-day, Emeline to-morrow, Lucy the day after.</q></p>

<p><q>" Brigham&#8217;s lawfully wedded wife was Mary Ann Angell,&#8212;a native
of New York,&#8212;the mother of five children,&#8212;Joseph, or <q>" Joe "</q> as he
                    
<pb n="256" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.269"/>
                    
is called at Salt Lake, Brigham A., John, Alice and Luna. She
married the prophet while he was a young man, before he was a
prophet, and with him accepted the revelations of Joseph Smith. She
lives in a large stone building in the rear of the harem. Brigham does
not often visit her now.</q></p>

<p><q>" His first concubine is Lucy Decker. She is the lawful wife of Isaac
Seely, mother of two children; but Brigham could make her a queen
in heaven, and so, bidding good-by to Isaac, she became first concubine, 
and has added eight children to the prophet&#8217;s household.</q></p>

<p><q>"Her younger sister, Clara Decker, also aspired to be a heavenly
queen, and became his second concubine, and is the mother of four
children.</q></p>

<p><q>" The third is Harriet Cook, mother of one turbulent boy, who does
pretty much as he pleases, as does the mother. When in her tantrums 
she does not hesitate to send Brigham to the realm of evil spirits.</q></p>

<p><q>" Lucy Bigelow is said to be one of the most lady-like of all the
concubines. Mrs. Waite, wife of one of the United States Judges of
the Territory, who saw all of the ladies of the harem, describes her as
of middling stature, dark brown hair, blue eyes, aquiline nose and a
pretty mouth. She is pleasant and affable.</q></p>

<p><q>"Miss Twiss has sandy hair, round features, blue eyes, low forehead,
freckled face, but as she has no children, is not of much account
in the eyes of the prophet. She looks after his clothes, sews buttons
on his shirts, and acts the part of a housewife.</q></p>

<p><q>" Martha Bowker is another of the same sort, quiet, neat in dress,
childless, and therefore of little account.</q></p>

<p><q>" Harriet Barney, like Lucy Decker, left her husband and three children
to become a concubine that she might have exaltation in Heaven,
but has not been honored in the harem, not having added any children
to the household.</q></p>

<p><q>"Eliza Burgess is the only English woman in the harem, small of
stature, black eyes. quick-tempered, but mother of several children.</q></p>

<p><q>" Ellen Rockwood, daughter of the jail-keeper, is another of the
unfortunate women&#8212;not having had children.</q></p>

<p><q>"Mrs. Hampton, whose first husband died at Nauvoo, afterward
married a man by the name of Cole, who left her at Nauvoo and went
to California. Brigham, hearing of his departure, sent for the wife,
who obeyed the summons and became a concubine, lived in the harem

<pb n="257" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.270"/>
                    
eight years, then was cast out by Brigham. She now lives at Ogden
City with her son, Nephi Hampton.</q></p>

<p><q>" Mary Bigelow is another castaway. She lived in the harem several
years, but Brigham became tired of her and sent her away.</q></p>

<p><q>" Margaret Pierce is another who, not having added to the glory of
the prophet by being a mother, is of little account, though still in the
harem.</q></p>

<p><q>"Emeline Free, as described by Mrs. Waite, is the <q>" light of the
harem,"</q> tall, graceful, mild, violet eyes, fair hair, inclined to curl.
She was a lively young lady, and Brigham fell in love with her. Her
father and mother were opposed to polygamy, but Emeline had ambitious 
projects, accepted his proposal and became the favorite of the
harem. The favor shown her brought on a row. The other concubines 
carried this jealousy to such a pitch that the prophet had a private
pasage constructed from his bed-room to Emeline&#8217;s room, so that his
visits to her and her&#8217;s to him could be made without observation. She
has contributed greatly to his glory in the future world by presenting
him with eight children in this.</q></p>

<p><q>"The poetess of the church is Eliza Snow, said to be quite intellectual.
In one of her poems published in Brigham&#8217;s paper, the &#8217;Deseret News,&#8217;
she thus exalts the Mormon religion;</q></p>

<lg><l>&#8216; We have the ancient order,</l>
<l>To us by prophets given:</l>
<l>And here we have the pattern</l>
<l>As things exist in heaven!&#8217;</l></lg>

<p><q>"From which we are to understand that there are harems in heaven!
So the Turk believes.</q></p>

<p><q>"Zina Huntington also writes poetry and acts as a sort of governess
to the numerous children of the prophet. Zina came to Salt Lake with
her lawfully wedded husband, Dr. Jacobs. Brigham liked her, sent
the doctor on a missionary tour to England, took his wife into the harem,
and became the spiritual father of her children,&#8212;made her his temporal
concubine that he might also exalt her to be a queen in heaven! The
doctor returned from his mission, apostatized, and went to California,
where he now resides.</q></p>

<p><q>"Amelia Partridge has added four children to the prophet&#8217;s 
household. She is said to be of a sweet disposition and is not jealous when
the prophet turns his attentions to the other concubines.</q></p>

<pb n="258" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.271"/>

<p><q>"Mrs. Augusta Cobb was formerly a Bostonian, became converted
to Mormonism eighteen years ago,left her home and accepted a position
in the harem.</q></p>

<p><q>"Mrs. Smith, a devout Mormon, wished to be sealed to Brigham for
eternity, but the prophet did not care to make her a heavenly queen.
He sealed her to Joseph Smith for eternity and to himself for time.</q></p>

<p><q>"One 'poor unfortunate' Clara Chase, became a maniac, and has
gone to where the wicked cease from troubling.</q></p>

<p><q>" Amelia Folsom, a native of Portsmouth, N. H., is the mistress of
the harem. She entered it on the 29th of January, 1863. She was
then about nineteen and the prophet sixty-three. She has things
pretty much her own way,&#8212;private box at the theater, carriage of her
own, silks, satins, a piano, parlor elegantly furnished. If the prophet
slights her, she pays him in his own coin."</q></p>

<!--

<p>What will become of the Mormons? Is polygamy
to be fastened upon our social institutions, and are
we to have a State of polygamists? If not, how is
the evil to be cured? These are questions that every
visitor in Utah, every student of the anomaly there
so flourishing, asks of himself and of his neighbor.
They seemed easier of answer in 1865 than now in
1869, for both polygamy and the power of the church
that backs it have greatly increased since then; and
yet I cannot but think we are nearer the solution of
the problem,&#8212;not only as to time, but in means,&#8212;
now than then. The whole spirit of the social life, the
religion, the political government in operation there, is
in such antagonism to everything American, to everything modern,
that it must give way. It is Romish,

<pb n="260" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.273"/>
                    
barbaric, monarchical; it crushes and degrades the
individual, to uphold a system as tyrannical over persons and 
property as that of any Czar ever was, as
supreme over the mind as that of any Pope, as enslaving to 
woman as that of any Sultan. The Railroad now crosses the Territory;
it will soon pass up and down through it; and though the Apostles say
they are not afraid of its influences, either upon the
Mormon church or its <q>" peculiar institution,"</q> and
Brigham Young declares that his <q>"must, indeed, be
a. &#8212; poor religion, if it cannot stand one railroad,"</q> he
and they will find out that it cannot and will not.
Thousands of Gentiles will come in now, where tens
came before; the railroads must have great work
and supply shops at important points in the Territory; 
and they will bring a power of numbers and of
influence, that cannot be met by the social, business
or murdering persecutions, that have heretofore kept
all foreign and resisting elements timid and weak.</p>

<p>What precise form the revolution will take,&#8212;where
the wedge will be entered that shall split this rotten
trunk to pieces, no one can wisely predict. The government 
cannot longer be so indifferent and neglectful of the 
situation here as it has been; it must come
here with authority and power to protect citizens who
are not Mormons, and will not be subservient to them,
who will try titles to property with them, who will
claim the right to marry their superfluous wives, who
will set up rival churches and schools and papers, and
all the other enginery of freedom and revolution. The
work may be slow,&#8212;sapping the strength of the church
by the processes of education, discussion and law, and

<pb n="261" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.274"/>
polygamy may fade away by degrees through the
death of the old, and the absence of new disciples,
&#8212;or it may come suddenly and sharply in a violent
collision between the new settlers and the old, with
the government taking the side of the former as the
side of its long-neglected, long-outraged laws. But
come it must and will. To doubt would be to question 
progress, to deny civilization, to outrage God.</p>

<p>I can discover no successor to Brigham Young.
He has men of ability,&#8212;men of fanaticism and 
courage,&#8212;around him; able instruments for his will; but
I see no <q>" coming man"</q> for his place; no one who
can stand alone in his shoes, who can command such
obedience among followers, such fear among outsiders, 
such serene victory over himself Most of
his wisest and ablest associates, men inspired with
the traditions of the church, and inspiring the faith
of its members, are all old like himself. They and
he must soon die; and, if not before, then will enter
in the elements of doubt and difference and disintegration, 
in response to the elements of change and
revolution and re-creation that follow the banners of
civilization and of democracy everywhere. No Mormon will 
admit this, perhaps; but it is truth by a
diviner sight than any that he possesses. Devout as
a Mussulman, devoted as a Romanist, zealous as a
Methodist, there is a higher truth than he has mastered,
&#8212;the truth of revolution in the interests of
equality, of individuality, and of woman&#8217;s independence. 
These are against him; these will conquer him,
pray he ever so sacredly, fight he ever so valiantly.
Brigham Young, Louis Napoleon, the Sultan and the

<pb n="262" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.275"/>
                    
Pope are all doomed by the same law. Slavery
went down under it, polygamy will follow.</p>

<p>But the government should no longer hold a doubtful 
or divided position toward this great crime of the
Mormon church. Declaring clearly both its want of
power and disinclination to interfere at all with the
church organization as such, or with the latter&#8217;s 
influence over its followers, assuring and guaranteeing
to it all the liberty and freedom that other religious
sects hold and enjoy, the government should still,
as clearly and distinctly, declare, by all its action
and all its representatives here, that this feature of
polygamy, not properly or necessarily a part of the
religion of the Mormons, is a crime by the common
law of all civilization and by the statute law of the
Nation, and that any cases of its extension will be
prosecuted and punished as such. Now half or two-
thirds the federal officers in the Territory are polygamists; 
and others bear no testimony against it.
These should give way to men who, otherwise
equally Mormons it may be, still are neither polygamists 
nor believers in the practice of polygamy.
No employes or contractors of the government should
be polygamists in theory or practice.</p>

<p>Here the government should take its stand, calmly,
quietly, but firmly, giving its moral support and
countenance, and its physical support, if necessary for
fair play, to the large class of Mormons who are not
polygamists, to missionaries and preachers of all other
sects, who choose to come here, and erect their
standards and invite followers; and to that growing
public opinion, here and elsewhere, which is 
<choice><orig>accumu-

<pb n="263" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.276"/>
                    
lating</orig><reg>accumulating</reg></choice> its inexorable
force, against an institution which
has not inaptly been termed a twin barbarism with
slavery. There is no need and no danger of physical
conflict growing up; only a hot and unwise zeal and
impatience on the part of the government representatives, 
and in the command of the troops stationed
here, could precipitate that. There is a possibility
still, as there was probability in 1865, that, upon such
a demonstration by the government, as these pages
urge, the leaders of the church would receive new
light on the subject themselves,&#8212;perhaps have a
fresh revelation, and abandon the objectionable feature 
in their polity. No matter if they did not,&#8212;it
would soon, under the influences now rapidly aggregating, 
and thus reinforced by the government, abandon them.</p>

<p>In this way, all violent conflict would, I believe,
be successfully avoided; and all this valuable population 
and its industries and wealth may be retained in
place and to the Nation, without waste. Let the people
continue to be Mormons, if they choose, so long as
they are not polygamists. They may be ignorant
and fanatical, and imposed upon and swindled even,
by their church leaders; but they are industrious,
thriving, and more comfortable than, on the average, 
they have ever been before in the homes from
which they came hither; and there is no law against
fanaticism and bigotry and religious charlatanry. All
these evils of religious benightment are not original
in Utah, and they will work out their own cure here,
as they have done elsewhere in our land. We must
have patience with the present, and possibly 
<choice><orig>forgive-
                    
<pb n="264" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.277"/>
                    
ness</orig><reg>forgiveness</reg></choice> for supposed crimes in the past by the leaders, because we have 
heretofore failed to meet the issues promptly and clearly, 
and have shared, by our consent and protection to 
their authors, in the alleged wrongs.</p>

<p>Though the Territory has abundant population for
a State, there is and should be no disposition in 
Congress or the country to endow it with that organization, 
so long as its people continue to be so at variance
with all the democratic principles of our nationality.
It must be kept, at least, where the federal government 
can reach and govern it, so long as its local
organization is such a pure religious autocracy, ruling
in a manner defiant alike of the laws and constitution
of the United States, and the first principles of a
republican government. Not only is a tree press and
a free speech practically denied; not only is justice
driven out of the courts; but the simplest rights of a
man over his own property are outraged. When a
Mormon dies, the church assumes control of his
estate,&#8212;it goes practically into the common coffers,
and the widows and children, however numerous, get
henceforth only what the church chooses to give
them. The idea of dividing the Territory up among
the adjoining Territories is not practicable now; under it, 
the Mormons, instead of being divided and
conquered, would divide and conquer; for, with their
numbers and discipline, they could out-vote and out-
manage three territories. The changes of population,
by the opening of the Railroad and the discovery of
new mines in adjoining sections of Nevada, will soon
suggest the practical manner of reforming the 
<choice><orig>Mor-
                    
<pb n="265" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.278"/>
                    
mons</orig><reg>Mormons</reg></choice>,&#8212;very likely reform them by their own operation, and without the government 
being more than a policeman on guard to keep the peace.</p>

<p>The soldiers at Camp Douglas, near Salt Lake
City, were, during our visit, illustrating one of the
ways in which polygamy will fade away before the
popular principle. Two companies, who went home 
to California in the fall of 1864, took about twenty-
five wives with them, recruited from the Mormon
flocks. There were in 1865 some fifty or more women
in the camp, who had fled thither from town for protection, 
or been seduced away from unhappy homes
and fractional husbands; and all or nearly all found
new husbands among the soldiers. Only the week
we were there, a man with three daughters, living in
the city, applied to Colonel George for leave to move
up to the camp for a residence, in order, as he said,
to save his children from polygamy, into which the
bishops and elders of the church were urging them.
The camp authorities tell many like stories; also of
sadder applications, if possible, for relief from actual
poverty and from persecution in town. The Mormons have no 
poor-house, and say they have no poor,
permitting none by relieving all through work or gifts.
But a late winter was so long and so severe, with wood
at thirty and forty dollars a cord, that there was much
real suffering, and the soldiers yielded to extensive
demands upon their charity, that the church authorities had 
neglected to fulfill, or absolutely denied.</p>

<p>We hear less of late than in past years of the order
of the <q>"Danites,"</q> a band of secret Mormon assassins,
who, under the direction of Brigham Young, put out

of the way any particularly threatening or provoking
opponents of the church. But of their existence and
diabolical operations there can be no doubt. In the
fall of 1857 a Mormon sued Brigham Young for false
imprisonment; the day before the suit came to court
he was shot in his own house. In 1858, two men
obtained a judgment of the court against a leading
Danite, and both were shot in cold blood. About the
same time, Mr. Babbitt, Secretary of the Territory,
had a quarrel with Young, and was murdered. In
1866, Mr. Beanfield of Austin, Nevada, a highly 
respectable gentleman, had some difficulty with the 
Mormons, and was shot. In October, the same year, Dr. 
Robinson, Surgeon of the United States Army, who
had taken possession of unoccupied land, was called
from his house at night to visit a patient, and was
shot. In August, 1867, three men,&#8212;Potter, Wilson
and Walker,&#8212;who had given offense to the church,
were arrested on the pretense of stealing a cow and
put into jail. At midnight sixteen Avengers, disguised, 
broke open the jail and murdered all three.
The United States Marshal arrested them, but the
Mormon Sherif permitted them to escape, without
any effort to retain them; and the <q>"Deseret News,"</q>
the organ of the church, published a threatening letter 
to Judge Titus and backed it up by editorials,
warning the Chief Justice to leave the Territory,
and menacing him with death if he remained!</p>

<p>Some of these sharp and swift punishments for
offending or resisting the Mormons have been on a
larger scale. The Mountain Meadow massacre <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Dates">of a

<!-- Section Not Relevant to Mountain Meadows:

<p>There have been two or three prominent apostasies
from the church in the Territory during its history.
The two most important were those of Joseph Morris
in 1860, and of Joseph Smith, Jr., son of the original
prophet, in 1863-5. Of the followers of Morris, some
were killed and nearly all robbed by the Mormon
leaders in Salt Lake City in 1862, under pretense of
enforcing the confiscations of the church against them
for their rebellious conduct; and those who held out
against this assault and the continuous persecution of
the church, some eighty families, moved off to Idaho
Territory, and have made a settlement there. The
disciples of Joseph Smith, Jr., or <q>"Josephites,"</q> are
scattered in Missouri and Iowa, number about fifteen
hundred, and include several hundred who left Utah
in 1864-5, under government protection, for fear of
massacre by the instruments of Young. Smith is a
man of sincerity and purity, but lacks the courage and
the force to cope fairly with the combination under
Brigham Young at Salt Lake City. His creed denounces 
Young and his followers as apostates from the true 
Mormon church, forbids polygamy, and professes loyalty 
to the government. The Josephites are thus reduced to a mere sect of Protestantism, as

<pb n="269" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.282"/>
                    
Mormonism would be in the overthrow of polygamy
and the severance of its church government from
State craft.</p>

<p>All our experience and observation in Utah tended,
however, to increase our appreciation of the value of
its material progress and development to the nation;
to justify congratulations to the Mormons and to the
country for the wealth they have created and the
order, frugality, morality and industry that have been
organized in this remote spot in our Continent; to
excite wonder at the perfection and power of their
church system, the extent of its ramifications, the
sweep of its influence; and to enlarge our respect for
the personal sincerity and character of many of the
leaders in the organization;&#8212;but also, on the other
hand, to deepen our disgust at their polygamy, and
strengthen our convictions of its barbaric and degrading 
influences. They have tried it and practiced
it under the most favorable circumstances, perhaps
under the mildest form possible; but, now as before,
here as elsewhere, it tends to and means only the
degradation of woman. By it and under it, she becomes 
simply the servant and serf, not the companion
and equal of man; and the inevitable influence of
this upon all society need not be depicted.</p>

<p>And so we could not, and cannot yet, doubt that,
sooner or later, before the influences of emigration,
civilization and our democratic habits, an organization 
so aristocratic and autocratic as the Mormon
church now is must modify its rule; it must compete
with other sects, and take its chance with them. And
especially, that its most aristocratic and uncivilized

<pb n="270" xml:id="mmm.wa.bowles.1869.283"/>
                    
incident or feature of plurality of wives must fall first
and completely before contact with the rest of the
world,&#8212;marshalled with mails, daily papers, railroads
and telegraphs,&#8212;ciphering out the fact that the men
and women of the world are about equally divided, and
applying to the Mormon patriarchs the democratic
principle of equal and exact justice. Nothing can
save this feature of Mormonism but new flight and a
more complete isolation. A kingdom in the sea, entirely 
its own, could only perpetuate it; and thither,
even, commerce and democracy would ultimately follow it. 
The click of the telegraph and the roll of
the overland stages were its unheeded death-rattle;
the whistle of the locomotive will speedily sound its
requiem; and the pickax of the miner is already
digging its grave. Squatter sovereignty must ere
long settle the question, even if the government 
continues to coquette with the offense and humor the
offenders, as it has done. Our bachelor stage-driver
out of Salt Lake, who said he expected to have a
revelation soon to take one of the extra wives of a
Mormon saint, is a representative of the Coming Man.
Let the Mormons look out for him! </p>
