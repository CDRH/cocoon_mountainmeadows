<dateline>Nevada Democrat, 4 November 1857</dateline>

<p><seg type="Coverage" subtype="Western"><seg type="Blame" subtype="EmigrantBehavior"><seg type="Encounter" subtype="Slander">The most probable reason assigned for the massacre, is this: <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="Route"><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">The train</seg> stopped some weeks near <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName></seg>, and the men were very free in expressing their opinion of the Mormons. Feeling perfectly secure in their arms and numbers, they are said to have been reckless, and would commit little acts of annoyance for the purpose of provoking the Saints, and seemed to set at defiance all the powers that could be brought against them</seg>. These imprudences were doubtless the cause of <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">the whole company</seg>, <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">with the exception of fifteen infants</seg>, being slaughtered.</seg> <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">A portion of the property belonging to the company was in the possession of the Indians, and <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS">a Mormon elder was seen riding a horse which belonged to <persName key="Edwards, Silas">Silas Edwards</persName></seg>. <seg type="Context" subtype="IndianRelationsLDS">The Mormons were on the most friendly terms with the <orgName type="native" key="Indians">Indians</orgName>, which goes far to implicate them in this horrid work.</seg></seg> <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Location"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Dates">The massacre occurred on the 18th of September</seg>, about three hundred miles from <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake</placeName>, near the out-skirts of the Mormon settlements.</seg> <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">One hundred eighteen persons in all were murdered, of whom fifty-six were men, the others were women and children.</seg> <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Aftermath">Their bodies were left unburied.</seg></seg></p>
