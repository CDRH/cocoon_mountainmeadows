<p><seg type="Source" subtype="Government">The Commissioner of Indian Affairs has received the following interesting letter from the Superintendent of Indian Affairs in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>:</seg></p>

<p>SIR: I have just returned from a very laborious and difficult trip through the southern portions of<placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory"> this Territory</placeName>.  <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">I have succeeded in recovering sixteen children, and have them now in my possession.  It is said these are all that remain of probably <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">one hundred and forty men, women and children</seg> of the Mountain Meadow massacre in <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Dates">September, 1857</seg>.</seg></p>
  
<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">In December last there was a small boy among the Navajos, near <geogName type="waterway" key="Colorado River">the Colorado</geogName>, in <placeName type="settlement" key="Mexico Territory">Mexico Territory</placeName>, who, it is supposed, also belonged to this emigrant train.  I will allude to this boy in another communication. I was positively assured by the settlers in the neighborhood where I got the children, that I have all that were saved.  I have good reason for believing that none of these children have lived among the Indians at all.</seg></p>
  
<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">These children average from about three to nine and half years old; are intelligent and good looking; not one mean-looking child among them.  I have collected the following particulars in relation to these children:</seg></p>
  
<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">1. <persName key="John Calvin">Calvin</persName>, now 7 or 8 years old ; does not remember his name ; says they (his family) lived at <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas"><placeName type="settlement" key="Horsehead, AR">Horsehead</placeName>, <placeName type="county" key="Johnston County, AR">Johnston County</placeName>, Arkansas</seg>.  This boy had father, mother, and five brothers older than himself killed ; brothers named <persName key="Henry">Henry</persName>, <persName key="James">James</persName>, <persName key="William">William</persName> and 
  <persName key="Larkin">Larkin</persName> ; and four sisters, <persName key="nancy">Nancy</persName>, <persName key="Mary">Mary</persName> and <persName key="Martha">Martha</persName>; his father <persName key="Joseph">Joseph</persName>, and his mother <persName key="Matilda">Matilda</persName>.  2 and 3. <persName key="Taggit, Abrose Mirem">Ambrose Mirem Taggit</persName>, now about 7 years old, and <persName key="Taggit, William Henry">William Taggit</persName>, now about 4&#189; years old; the elder boy says they had father, mother and two older brothers killed.  He says they lived <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas">in <placeName type="county" key="Johnston County, AR">Johnston County</placeName></seg>, and when they left the States they had a grandfather and grandmother living. 4. <persName key="Prudence Angeline">Prudence Angeline</persName>, 6 years old; and 5. <persName key="Annie">Annie</persName>; had father and mother, and two brothers named <persName key="James">James</persName> and <persName key="Johnah">Johnah</persName> killed.  6. A girl about 4&#189; years old says her name is <persName key="Hown/Korn, Frances">Frances Hawe, or Kern</persName>.  7  A boy, now about 3 years old; I have no account of this boy; those with whom he lived called him <persName key="William">William</persName>. 8.  <persName key="Huff, Elisha W.">Eliza W. Buff</persName>, 4 years old.  9.  <persName key="Huff, Nancy Sophronia">Sophronia or Mary Huff</persName>, about 6 years old.  10. <persName key="Francher, Kit Carson">Charles Francher</persName>, 7 or 8 years old; and 11. <persName key="Francher, Annie">Annie</persName> about 3&#189; years old, had sister.  12.  <persName key="Besty">Betrey</persName>, about 6 years old ; and 13. <persName key="Jane">Jane</persName> about 4 years old; have no account of these.  14, 15 and 16.  <persName key="Dunlap, Rebecca">Rebecca</persName>, <persName key="Dunlap, Louisa">Louisa</persName> and <persName key="Dunlap, Sarah">Sarah Dunlap</persName>.</seg></p>
  
<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors"><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas">In conversation with these children, I learn that they resided in the same neighborhood; my impression is, principally in <placeName type="county" key="Johnston County, AR">Johnston County</placeName>, <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Ark.</placeName></seg></seg></p>
