                MOUNTAIN MEADOWS.
                
                THE STORY OF THE MORMON MASSACRE.
                TESTIMONY AT LEE'S TRIAL—OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE AGAINST
                    THE MORMONS—THE MASSACRE PLANNED BY THE CHURCH—LEE THE
                    LEADER OF THE INHUMAN BUTCHERY.

                BEAVER, Utah, July 23. — At
                    2 o’clock to-day, the first witness in the trial of John D. Lee and others was called. Robert Keyes came to Utah
                        Territory Oct. 2, 1857, through the Mountain
                            Meadows; 
                        saw two piles of bodies of women
                            and children piled promiscuously, about sixty to seventy, the children
                            from two months old to twelve years; the smaller ones were torn by
                            wolves and crows; some bodies were shot, some had their throats cut,
                            some were stabbed, and all were torn by wolves except one woman a little
                            way off, who appeared as if she were asleep; there was a bullet hole in
                            her left side; from appearances the bodies had been dead for fifteen
                            days; seven of us saw them; the pile of men’s bodies was further on; did
                            not go to see them; there was no clothing on the bodies except a sock on
                            the foot of one man; none had been scalped.
                    

                Ashel Benuette, called: Was at the Meadows December, 1857; saw bones there—a horrible sight of
                            skeletons of women and children, with curls and long tresses of hair
                            dried in blood; the children were from ten to twelve years of age; some
                            of the skulls had the flesh dried on them; the bodies had been covered
                            up, but wolves evidently dug them out.

                
                    Phillip Klingen Smith a defendant
                        of San
                            Bernardino, Cal., was called. The prosecution entered a nolle prosequi as to himself: lived in Cedar City in 1857
                        since 1852; the Meadows are forty-five miles
                            south of Cedar
                                City, on the California road; was at the massacre in September, 1857: heard of emigrants coming; the
                            people were forbidden to trade with them; felt bad about it; saw a few
                            of them at Cedar
                                City; this was on Friday; some swore, and Higbee fined
                            them; they went on; heard rumors of trouble; 
                            on Sunday it was the
                                custom to have meetings of the President and Council, the Bishops
                                and Council, and the High Council; I was a Bishop; the question as
                                to their destruction came up for discussion; Haight, Higbee, Morrill, Allen, Willis, myself, and others, were there; some of the brethren
                                opposed destruction; I did; Haight jumped up and broke up the meeting; I asked
                                what would be the consequences of such an act; Haight then got mad;
                                the Indians were to destroy them on Monday; Higbee, Haight, White, and I met and discussed the same subject
                                again; I opposed their destruction; Haight relented, and told White and me to go ahead and tell the people that
                                the emigrants should go through safely, we did so; on the road we
                                met John Lee, and told him
                                where we were going; he replied that he had something to say about
                                that matter;
                         we passed the emigrants at Iron Springs, UT; next morning we passed
                        them again as we came back; they
                            had twenty or thirty wagons and numbered altogether over 100 persons, old and middle-aged men and
                                women, youths, and children; while
                                near home we met Ira Allen, he
                                said that the doom of the emigrants was sealed, and that the die was
                                cast for their destruction; also that Lee had orders to take men out
                                and intercept the emigrants, and that Allen was to go on and counteract what we had
                                done; I went home. Three days afterward Haight sent for me, and said that
                            orders had come from the camp that they did not get along, and wanted
                            reinforcements; that he had been to Parowan and got further orders from
                                Col. W. H. Dame to
                            finish the massacre, to decoy the emigrants out, and spare only the small children
                                who could not tell the tale; I went off and met Allen, our first runner, and others;
                                Higbee came out, and said
                            we were ordered out armed and equipped, so I went: Hopkins, Higbee, John Willis, and Sam Purdy, went along; we had two
                            baggage-wagons with us; we got to Hamblin’s ranch in the night, three miles from the
                            emigrants. We there met Lee and
                            others from the general camp, where the largest number of men were. We then found the emigrants were
                                not all killed.
                            Lee called me out for
                            consultation. He told me the situation. The emigrants, he said, were
                            strongly fortified. There was no chance of getting them out. Higbee gave orders to decoy them
                            out the best way we could. This was agreed to, and the command was given
                            to John D. Lee to carry out the
                            whole plan. They went to the camp; Lee placed all the soldiers in a hollow square and
                            addressed them. They were all white men, about fifty in all. The Indians
                            were in another camp; saw there Slade and his son; Jim
                                Pearce and probably his sons, too, all those from
                                Cedar,
                            and Bill Stewart, Levin Jacobs; I think Dan McFarlan too; Slade and I were outraged, but
                            we said, “What can we do? We can’t help ourselves;” just then the
                            order to march was given, and we had to go; we were put in double file;
                                Higbee had command of part of
                                the men; it was the Nauvoo
                                    Legion, organized from tens up to hundreds; we marched in sight of the
                                    emigrants; either Bateman or Lee went out with a white flag. A man from the
                                    emigrants met them. Lee
                                    and the man sat down on the grass and had a talk; don’t know
                                    what they talked about. Lee went with the man into the entrenchments.
                                    After some hours they came out and the emigrants came up with
                                    the wounded in wagons ahead. The wounded were those hurt in the
                                    three days’ previous fight; said the Mormons and Indians could
                                    not oust the emigrants; next came the women and next the
                                men; as the emigrants came up the men halted, and the women on foot
                                with the children and wounded, went on ahead with John D. Lee; the soldiers had to
                                be all ready to shoot at the word; when the word halt came the
                                soldiers fired; I fired
                                    once; don’t know if I killed the men; they were not all killed
                                    the first shot; saw the women afterward dead, with their throats
                                    cut; I saw as I came up to them, a man kill a young girl;
                                the men were marched in double file first, then thrown in single
                                file with soldiers alongside; heard the emigrants congratulating on
                                their safety from the Indians at last; Higbee came and ordered my
                                squad to fire; Lee, like the
                                rest, had fire-arms;
                            no emigrants escaped; saw
                                soldiers on horses to take on the wing those who ran; saw a man run;
                                saw Bill Stewart, on a
                                horse, go after one and kill him; saw one wounded man beg for his
                                life, but Higbee cut his
                                throat; the man said, “I would not do this to you, Higbee;” he knew
                                him;
                            after I fired, was told to
                                gather up little children; as I went I saw a large woman running toward the
                            men crying “My husband, my husband!” a soldier shot her in the
                            back and she fell dead. As I went on I found wagons, with wounded all
                            out on the ground, with their throats cut.
                        I went on and found children, and
                            put them in a wagon and took them to Hablin’s house. I saw no more. The
                            soldiers had dispersed. Two of the children were wounded. One died at
                            Hamblin’s. I think I had to leave it there. Many of the soldiers were
                            from southern counties, and I did not know them. Next day, I, McCurdy, and Willis took the children to Cedar City, leaving one at
                                Pinto Creek.
                            On the road we met a freight train of wagons. I went to old Mrs. Hopkins and told her we had children
                            with us. She bustled around and got places for them. I took one girl
                            baby home, and my wife suckled her. I afterward gave it to Birkbeck, he having no children. The
                            children were well treated, I believe. Good places were obtained for
                            them.
                

                
                    The question of allowing the statements of the
                            co-conspirators as to to the disposal of the emigrants property after
                            the massacre was here argued for an hour. The court held it
                            admissible. During the argument, Sutherland, for the defense, said it was an attempt to fix
                        the crime on some one else, Lee
                        being only the figurehead.
                

                
                    A. Baskin, for the prosecution, replied he wanted but the
                        truth whoever it implicated; that Sutherland feared his real client would be reached,(decided
                        sensation, it being known that Brigham
                            Young was meant.)
                

                
                    Witness resumed: After several days Haight
                
                
                
                    sent me to the Iron Springs, where the wagons,
                            cattle, and goods of the emigrants were, to get them and put them in the
                            tithing-house; I was to brand the cattle too; found there John Gorie and Hunter, and Allen;
                            I put the goods in the Church tithing-office cellar; left the wagons in
                            front of the tithing office; branded the cattle with the Church brand, a
                            cross; Lee was in the cellar
                            with me and saw the goods;
                        Haight and Higbee told me a council had been held
                        and Lee deputed to go to President
                            Brigham Young and report all
                        the facts of the massacre; Lee went,
                        and I followed to attend to conference
                            Oct. 6 at Salt
                                Lake City; met Lee at Salt Lake; asked if he had reported to Brigham Young; he said yes, every
                            particular; same day I,
                                Lee, and Charley Hopkins called on
                                Brigham Young; he there ,
                            in presence of them, said, “You have charge of that property in the
                                tithing office, turn it over to John D.
                                    Lee. What you know of this, say nothing of it; don’t
                                talk of it even among yourselves; had to go to Vegas Lead Mines
                            to get more ore; while I was gone Lee took the property, had an auction, and sold it off;
                            so Haight and Higbee told me: Haight sold part of the cattle to
                                Hooper, afterward
                            Congressional delegate, for boots and shoes;
                        there were Indians at the
                            massacre; the hills were pretty full of them; they were disputed to kill
                            the women; I saw an Indian cut
                                a boy’s throat; I heard of no effort to restrain the Indians;
                            three of them died from wounds received from the emigrants. The Indians
                            came back to Cedar, where they lived. Two of their chiefs’ names
                            were Bill and Tom. I saw some of
                                the emigrants’ property in the possession of the Indians. I
                            saw Lee get dresses and jeans
                            from the tithing office out of the emigrants’ plunder.
                        I learned from Allen that Lee was the one to gather up the Indians to attack the
                            emigrants. I talked with Lee
                            about it afterward. Lee was
                            Indian agent at Harmony, traded with the tribes, and issued goods and
                            rations from the Government to the Indians.
                

                The court here adjourned.

                After to-day night sessions will be held.

                The court has warned the citizens not to speak to the jurors from the street, and
                    declares that such an offense will be punished.

                
                    During the time that Klingen Smith was testifying,
                        giving the horrible details of the massacre, the suspense was terribly
                        painful. Lee’s square, hard,
                        low-browed face and neck became fairly purple and black. His wives scarcely
                        breathed, straining forward to catch each syllable.
                

                The excitement in town is intense.
                    It is understood that Klingen
                        Smith’s story, in all the material details, is the same as
                        Lee’s suppressed confession as to
                    the massacre. Klingen Smith’s
                    reputation here is that of a man of truth. He could not be impeached save by
                    facts.
