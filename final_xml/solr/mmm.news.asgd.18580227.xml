               Public Meeting of the People of Carroll County


                At a public meeting of the citizens of Carroll county, held in Carrollton, on the 1st
                    day of February, 1858, in pursuance of public notice, the following proceeding
                    were had:

                On motion, John Crump, Esq. was called on
                    and unanimously selected to act as president of the meeting, and John Haggin was appointed secretary.

                On motion, it was determined that the president should appoint a committee of
                    three to draft suitable resolutions for the occasion, and such as would be
                    expressive of the feelings and sense of the meeting.

                Thereupon, the following named gentlemen were appointed such committee, to wit:
                        Bryce Byrne, W. W. Watkins and John Haggin. The committee after deliberating
                    and considering of their duty, reported the following preamble and resolutions
                    which were unanimously concurred in and adopted:

                WHEREAS, The painful intelligence has reached us that, in July last, an emigrant train with 130 persons
                        from
                        Arkansas
                    was attacked by the Mormons and Santa Clara tribe of Indians
                    near the rim of the Great Basin, and
                        about fifty miles from Cedar
                            City, in Utah Territory, and that all of the emigrants, with the exception of 15 children, were then
                        and there massacred and murdered—that the children thus saved from the dreadful fate
                            of their parents and the rest of their company were delivered over to
                            the custody of the Mormons of Cedar city; and that among those who
                        were with the said train at the time of the massacre were John T. Baker and sons, George and Able, Charles
                        and Joel Mitchell,
                        sons of Col. Wm. C.
                        Mitchell, of Marion county, Allen
                            Derhazo, George
                            Baker's wife and 
                            
                                
                                    four children

                        , widow Huff
                        (whose husband, Peter Huff, died
                        after they had started on the route) and some others—all of whom were our neighbors,
                            friends and acquaintances, and their families, and the same persons who
                            constituted the company that left Carroll county in April last,
                            for California, and
                            which was known as Baker's company. And
                            whereas it appears from many other instances of atrocity and crime which
                            could be recited, that the Mormons
                            are instigating the Indians to hostilities against our citizens, and
                        are and have been as a community, systematically engaged in the infamous
                        work of robbing and murdering peaceful wayfarers and emigrants and resisting
                        the authority and laws of the United States-and in short of rebellion and
                        treason against the general government; therefore be it

                Resolved: 
                            That we, the people of
                                    Carroll
                                    county, feeling deeply aggrieved in consequence of
                                the many and continued outrages committed upon the persons and
                                property of our citizens, by the Mormons
                                and Indians, acting under their instigation, and especially
                                on account of the loss of such a number of our most estimable
                                citizens, countrymen and friends, and their wives and children in
                                the late massacre of an emigrant train near Cedar city, in Utah
                                    Territory
                        , do hereby petition, and call upon the government of the United
                        States to have thoroughly investigated the affair of said dreadful tragedy,
                        and deal out retributive justice to the parties guilty of the monstrous
                        deed.

                Resolved, 
                        That as it appears from reliable
                            information, there were spared and saved from destruction as many as
                            fifteen infant children, in said massacre, that we hereby call on the
                            general government for assistance and aid in rescuing said children from
                            their captors, and restoring them to their relations and friends in
                                Arkansas
                    .

                Resolved, That we request our 
                        representatives 
                    and 
                        senators 
                    in congress to use their influence and best exertions to have passed
                    an act making an appropriation for the purpose of defraying the expenses which
                    it may be necessary to incur in order to reclaim and bring home to their
                    relations the children which were as aforesaid saved from the massacre.

                Resolved, That we offer our condolence and sympathy to the distressed parents and
                    immediate relations of the unfortunate adventurers who met on plains, as
                    aforesaid, such a lamentable fate.

                Resolved, That in our opinion
                        the government should immediately adopt decisive measures for subduing the
                        spirit of insubordination and treason, that is now rife amongst the Mormons, and to that end should call on Arkansas for volunteers, and
                        that we, the people of Carroll county, hold ourselves ready to respond to any such
                        call for volunteers, by tendering the services of at least four
                        companies.

                Resolved, That the True
                        Democrat and the Gazette and Democrat,
                    are hereby requested to publish the proceedings of this meeting.
                
                    JOHN CRUMP, President.
                    JOHN HAGGIN, Secretary.
