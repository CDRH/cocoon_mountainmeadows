"In chemistry," said Sydenham, "certain tests may be applied to determine certain results; so in the moral and political world: the mass seems made up of so many different elements that it is hard to tell which predominates. Doubtless there was, and is, with many, a sincere belief that negro servitude is wicked and wrong, and some of this class may have a strong sense of justice toward particular classes, and some, or, possibly, a majority of all the people, may appreciate and wish to apply the principles of justice to all; yet, that these principles did not animate Congress, at that time, is clearly proved by the fact that no attention was paid to the Indian treaties; or, rather, that after their attention was particularly called to them, they proceeded to deliberately trample them under foot. One party professed great devotion to a principle—the principle of popular sovereignty; a princi-



pleprinciple sound in the main, but by no means infallible. And yet its supporters claimed nothing less than absolute infallibility for their pet, dogma—and that, with the example of Utah before their eyes."

"Were the perpetrators of the 'Mountain Meadows' massacre ever brought to justice?" enquired the other.

"No, not one of that infamous band were ever brought to justice. The government officials and the people could not see farther west than Kansas. As to the political parties, neither seemed to be alive to that fearful deed of blood, (in cruelty equaling and in treachery surpassing far the wild warfare of the savages) although most keenly alive to whatever might advance their chances of success in the elections. In the great crucible of American politics, the Kansas and Nebraska bill, therefore, furnishes for future historians a test. It proves that in neither political party was there a majority in Congress whose course was influenced solely by a desire to do right for its own sake, and that other motives and aims warped them from the straight and narrow path of truth."
