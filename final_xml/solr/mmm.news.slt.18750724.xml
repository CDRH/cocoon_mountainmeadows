FEARFUL SCENES ON THE BATTLE GROUND AFTER THE BUTCHERY.



Special to the TRIBUNE 1

Beaver, July 23.— At the opening of the court this morning, District Attorney, Carey made a powerful opening address. He traced the progress of the emigrant party from their homes in Arkansas, and Missouri to Salt Lake, where they in camped on the banks of the Jordan river to refresh their animals and purchase supplies. They were ordered away and supplies refused them. They again started westward through the Territory, but no order had preceded them to all the settlements they passed through to





SELL THEM NOTHING,

This was obeyed. Some settlers stole into their camp by night to give them little comforts, and one man was cut off from the church for so doing. While the story was being told with entire accuracy, it was listened to breathlessly. He then detailed what he would show by witnesses. 

The witnesses were then examined. H.H. Keyes, who passed over the spot two weeks after the massacre, gave a vivid description of the pools of blood and aol bodies stripped naked, composed of women and children. There were about fifty bodies in this pile. The wolves and crows had mutilated the remains.	

Bennett, the second witness, rode over the ground two months after the massacre, and also described the appearance. The bones were stripped of the flesh and had been dragged out of the hole where they had been hastily buried.




Evidence of Philip Klingensmith.	

Philip Klingensmith, on the stand to-day, deposed in substance as follows: Lived at Cedar City in 1857; had lived there since 1852; knew the prisoner in 1857, and was at Mountain Meadows at the time of the massacre; heard the company of emigrants was coming south, and the people were forbidden to trade with them. The company came to Cedar City; this might be on Friday; company went on from there on Sunday. There was a meeting of Bishop’s Counselors and High counselors; witness was a bishop, but held no military office. This meeting was to talk over the emigrant party, and the




QUESTION OF THEIR DESTRUCTION.

The council was composed of Haight, Higbee, witness, Allen and others. Opposition was made to it; witness was opposed; some favored it. The meeting broke up in confusion and went out of doors. On Monday the subject was again discussed and witness was again opposed to it. Haight sent witness and Sam White to Pinto Creek to tell the people to let the emigrants pass; started in the afternoon, and saw Lee in a field. He asked where we were going; witness told him; Lee said I have something to say to that. The last witness saw of the train was at Iron Springs, in the morning, as they were drawing out as we passed back. There were between twenty-five to thirty wagons, and 100 or more people. Coming home the day following, I met Ira Allen, who said the




DOOM OF THE EMIGRANTS IS SEALED.

John D. Lee had orders from headquarters at Parowan to take men and go south. Joe Willett had orders to go to Pinto creek and revoke the orders to let the emigrants pass. Three days afterwards, Haight came to MacFarlands and said word had come in from camp last night; they had not got along as anticipated and wanted reinforcements. Haight went to Parowan to get instructions and there he received orders from Col. Dame to




DECOY THE EMIGRANTS OUT

And spare nothing but the small children who could not tell tales. Higbee said to the witness, you are ordered out, armed and equipped as the law directs. I went and got my horse and arms and started out with Charley Hopkins, Higbee, Willis and Wagon. Sam Murdy and Wagon and others, reached Hamblin’s ranch at night; found Lee and others, and found how matters stood at camp. Lee called witness on one side and told him the emigrants were strongly fortified and there was no way to get them out. Higbee said he had orders to decoy them out disarmed. This was agreed upon and the execution of the plot intrusted to Lee. The order was then given to march to the spring where the Indians and Southern soldiers were encamped; and when the company from Washington county arrived there, Lee formed them into a battalion square and instructed the troops how to act; about fifty men were in line—not an Indian amongst them, witness and the old man were outside the line talking the matter over. It struck both as horrible and both opposed it; witness said what can we do? How can we help ourselves? Slade said we can’t resist; we were ordered to march down about one and one-half miles; Higbee and his officers took command; the organization was called


	

THE NAUVOO LEGION	

We were halted a quarter of a mile from the emigrants and in full sight. A man went on with a flag of truce; a person came out from the emigrant camp and Lee went down and he and the emigrant negotiated. They sat down and had a long talk. Lee then went inside the camp and the soldiers stood in line three or four hours, Lee was inside the entrenchment the most of the time, and finally the emigrants came out.




THE SURRENDER	

Higbee ordered the proceedings. Lee went ahead with the wagons containing the men wounded in the attack made by the Indians. The arms of the party and the young, children and women were marched behind; the men came out next in double rank. The soldiers marched by their side with their pieces across their arms. We were protecting the emigrants; some expressed their thankfulness at being delivered from the Indians. We marched from a quarter to half a mile, and command was given to halt. The soldiers had been instructed when they halted,




TO FIRE ON THE EMIGRANTS;

Might have been shifted to single rank; which they were. Higbee gave the orders to fire; suppose there were fifty men killed, might have been more. 




NONE ESCAPED.

Saw some attempt; there were mounted men to dispatch the fugitives Bill Stewart chased one fleeing man; think I saw him fall; he did not go far. Ira Allen was mounted and placed on the left wing. Witness was with the men in the ranks and fired one time. 




JNO. M. HIGBEE CUT ONE MAN’S THROAT.

One large woman came running from the wagons calling for her husband. A man standing near to me shot her in the back and she fell dead. Being ordered to gather up the children, I went a quarter of a mile to the wagons; the wounded men had been killed before we got there; did not see Lee put the children in the wagon; went to Hamblin’s House. The soldiers then dispersed. The company from Washington county went south; company from Cedar City went to Hamblin’s. I had my hands full with the children; seventeen of them, from two to seven or eight years of age; two were wounded and one died on the way.




DIVIDING THE SPOILS.

The witness, then details the gathering and distribution of the property; the drought animals, wagons and clothing were taken to Cedar City; fifty head of the emigrants stock were branded with the Church brand (a cross). He also describes the meeting of Lee in Salt Lake, where he had been sent to report the massacre to Brigham Young. Witness and Charley Hopkins called upon Brigham; He directed witness to turn over the property to Lee; Brigham turned to witness and said; What do you know about this affair? Keep it secret and don’t talk about it among yourselves; Lee was present at this interview. Fifty head of cattle were driven to Salt Lake, and




SOLD TO HOOKER,

Formerly delegate to congress, for boots and shoes. Witness then tells how he was sent to the old lead mines at Vegas, Arizona with two others, in three teams, to get lead, and when he returned, the property in Cedar City had been auctioned off. 

This witness’ testimony was listened to with intense interest by the crowded court room. Much other important testimony was elicited which confirms the popular statement of the massacre.
