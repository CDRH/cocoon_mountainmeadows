    MOUNTAIN MEADOW MASSACRE.
    


    
     We give below, the affidavit of Philip Klingon Smith one of the bishops who obeyed the
      orders of Brigham in the butchery of Mountain
      Meadows. The fearful story requires no comment, nor does it admit of a doubt.
    

    
     
      State of Nevada, County of Lincoln ss: 
     

     
      Personally appeared before me, Peter B. Miller. Clerk of Court of the Seventh Judicial
       District of the State of Nevada, Phillip Klingon Smith, who being duly sworn, on his
       oath says: My name is Phillip Klingon Smith;
       I reside in the County of
        Lincoln, in the State of
       Nevada; I resided at Cedar
        City in the County of
        Iron, in the Territory of
        Utah, from A.D. 1852 to A.D. 1859; I was residing at Cedar City at the time of the massacre
        at Mountain Meadows, in said Territory of Utah; I had heard that a company of emigrants was on its way from Salt Lake City, bound for California; said company arrived at said Cedar City, carried there one day, and
        passed on for California; after said company had left Cedar City, the militia
        was called out for the purpose of commuting acts of hostility against them; said call was a
        regular military call from the superior officers to the subordinate officers and privates of
        the regiment at Cedar City and
        vicnity, composing part of the militia of the Territory of Utah; I do not recollect the number of the regiment. I was at the
        time the Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints at Cedar City; Isaac C. Haight was President over said church at
         Cedar City, and the southern
        settlements in said Territory any
        position as bishop is subordinate to that of said President. W. H. Dame was President of said church at Parowan, in said Iron County. Said Dame was also colonel of said regiment; and Isaac C. Haight was Lieutenant-colonel of said regiment, and said John D. Lee, of Harmony, in said Iron County, was Major. Said regiment was duly ordered to
        murder, armed and equipped as the law directs and I prepared for held operations. I had no command nor office in said regiment on the expedition which resulted
        in said companys’s being massacred at the Mountain Meadows in said county of Iron. About four days
        after said company of emigrants had left Cedar City that portion of said regiment then murdered at Cedar City took up its line of march in
        pursuit of them. About two days after said company had left Cedar City, Lieutenant-Colonel I. C. Haight expressed in my presence a desire that said
        company might be permitted to pass on their way in peace; 
         but afterwards he told me that he had orders to
          kill al of said company of emigrants except the little children
        . I do not know whether said headquarters  the regiment headquarters at
         Parowan or the headquarters of
        the Commander-in-chief at Salt Lake
         City. When the said company got to
          Iron Creek, about twenty miles from
          Cedar City, Captain
          Joel White started for the Pinto Creek Settlement, through which
         the said company would pass for the purpose of influencing the people to permit said
         company to pass on their way in peace. I asked and obatained permission of said White to go with him to aid him in trying to save life. When
         we got about three miles from Cedar
          City, we met Major J. D. Lee, who
         asked us where we were going. I replied that we were going to try to prevent the killing of
         the emigrants. Lee replied: “I have something to
          say about that.”
        Lee was at the time on his way to Parowan, the headquarters of Colonol Dame. Said White and I went to Pinto
         Creek; remained there one night, and the next day returned to Cedar City, meeting said company of
        emigrants at Iron Creek. Before
        reaching Cedar City we met one
         Ira Allen, who told us that “The decree had passed
         devoting said company to destructuion.”
        After the fight had been going on three or four days a
         message from Major Lee reached Cedar City, who stated that the fight
         had not been altogether successful, upon which Lieutenant-Colonel Haight ordered out a reinforcement. At this time I
        was ordered out by Captain John. M. Higby who
        ordered me to muster “armed and equipped as the law directs.” It was a matter of life
        or death to me to muster or not, and I mustered with the reinforcing troops. It was at this
        time that Lieutenant-Colonel Haight said to me
        that it was the orders from headquarters that 
         all but the little children of said company were
          to be killed
        . Said Haight had at that time just
        returned from headquarters at Parowan; where a military council had been held. There had been a like council
        held at Parowan previous to that,
        at which were present Colonel Dame,
        Lieutenant-colonel I. C. Haight and Major
         John. D. Lee. The result of this first council was
        the calling out of said regiment for the purpose already stated. The reinforcement aforesaid
        was marched to the Mountain
         Meadows, and there formed a junction with the main body. 
         Major Lee
          massed all the troops at a spring and made a speech to them, saying that his orders from
           “headquarters were to kill the entire company except the small children.”
        
        I was not in the ranks at the time, but on one side
         talking to a man named Slade, and could not
         have seen a paper Major Lee’s hands. Said Lee then sent a flag of truce to the emigrant camp, offering
         said emigrants that “if they laid down their arms he would protect them.” They
         accordingly laid down their arms, came out from their camp, and delivered themselves up to
         the said Lee. The women and children were then, by
         order of said Lee, seprated from the men and were
         marched ahead of the men. After the said emigrants had marched about a half mile towards
          Cedar City the order was
         given to shoot them down. At that time said Lee was at the head of the column. I was in the rear. I did not hear Lee give the order to fire, but heard it from the under
        officers as it was passed down the column. The emigrants were then and there shot down, except
          seventeen little children, which I immediately took into my charge. I do not know the
          total number of said company as I did not stop to count the dead. I immediately put
         the little children in baggage wagons belonging to the regiment and took them to Hamlin’s ranch, and from there to Cedar City, and procured them homes
         amoung the people, J. Willis and S. Murdy assisted me in taking charge of said children. On
         the evening of the massacre W. H. Dame and
         Lieut. I. C. Haight came to Hamlin’s where I had the said children, and fell
        into a dispute, in the course of which said Haight told Colonel Dame that if he
        was going to report of the killing of said emigrants he should not have ordered it done. I
        do not know when or where said troops were disbanded. About two weeks after said massacre
        occurred said Major Lee (who was also Indian agent)
        went to Salt Lake City
        and, as I believe, reported said fight and
        its results to the commander-in-chief: I was not present at either of the before mentioned
        councils, nor at any council connected with the aforsaid military operations or with said
        company. I gave no orders except to those connected
         with the surving of the children, and those after the massacre had occurred, and said
         orders were given as bishop and not in a military sense. At the time of the firing of the
         first volley I discharged my piece. I did not fire afterwards, though several subsequent
         volley’s were fired. After the first fire was delivered I at once set about saving children
         before the fring had ceased. I have made the foregoing statements before the above
        entitled court for the reason that I believe that I would be assassinated should I attempt
        to make the same before any court in the Territory of Utah. After said Lee
        returned from Salt Lake
         City, as aforesaid, said Lee told me
        that he had reported fully to the President, meaning the commander-in-chief, the fight at Mountain Meadows and the
         killing of said emigrants. Brigham Young
        was at the time commader-in-chief of the Militia of the Territory of Utah; and further deponent saith
       not.
