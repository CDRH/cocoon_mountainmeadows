There can no longer be any doubt but that all the central routes will be unsafe as an emigrant highway for a very long time. The Mormons will resist. The anymis animus by which they are actuated is no longer a matter of speculation. They are determined to precipitate a collision. They number at least ten thousand fighting men, and are in close alliance with at least fifty thousand hostile Indians. We are not of those who, for a moment, suppose that the troops which have been sent out to Utah will, in the event of a rupture, be sufficient for the subjugation of that turbulent despondency. On the contrary, it is by no means beyond the bounds of possibility that a protracted war may ensue.
