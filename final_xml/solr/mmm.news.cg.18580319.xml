MASSACRE OF CALIFORNIA EMIGRANTS.

Mr. GWIN. I offered yesterday a resolution of inquiry, to which the Senator from Texas (Mr. Houston) objected. I understand that this morning he is willing to withdraw his objection, as he finds that the resolution simply provides for an inquiry. I move that it be taken up.

The motion was agreed to; and the resolution was adopted, as follows:

Resolved, That the Secretary of War be requested to communicate to the Senate what steps have been taken, if any, to punish the parties implicated in the massacre of one hundred and eighteen emigrants to California, at the Mountain Meadows, in the Territory of Utah.
