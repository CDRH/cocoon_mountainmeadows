Murderous Outrages by the Mormons and their Indian Allies Confirmed.

    The Northern Light arrived at New York on Monday morning with two weeks later news from California. The news is down to the 19th from San Francisco. She brings 603 passengers, the usual Pacific and Atlantic mails and $2,118,652 78; in treasure, as follows: For New York, 1,744,672 78; for New Orleans, 366,350; and for Havana, $7,650.

Great Massacre of Emigrants.
The news published on the arrival of the last steamer, of the massacre of 118 emigrants, is fully confirmed. The evidence establishing the complicity of the Mormons in this outrage, is now sufficient to banish all doubt on that subject:

Indignation Meeting at Los Angeles
We learn from the Los Angeles Star that a mass meeting of citizens was held in that city on the 12th of October to investigate the facts in the recent massacre, on the Salt Lake road, of more than one hundred and twenty Americans, "Mr. W. A. Wallace read a statement of Mr. George Powers, of Little Rock, Ark., who had just arrived across the Plains. Mr. Powers says; on his, arrival last August, at Salt Lake: "We found the Mormons making very determined preparations to fight the United States troops, whenever they may arrive. On their way in, we met three companies of one hundred men each, armed, and on the road towards the pass above Fort Bridger. I was told at Fort Bridger, that at Fort Supply, there were four hundred armed Indians awaiting orders; they also said that there were 50,000 pounds of flour stored at Fort Bridger for the use of their army. We found companies drilling every evening in the city. The Mormon declared to us that no United States troops should ever cross the mountains; and they talked and acted as if they were willing to take a brush with Uncle Sam. Mr. Powers kept onto Cedar City, 230 miles west of Salt Lake, when he met three Mormons from the scene of slaughter, in company with a band of some twenty Indian warriors. One of the men in company with Mr. Dame, was Mr. Haight, President of Cedar City. Mr. Dame said they had been out to see to the burying of the dead; but the dead were not buried. From what I heard, I believe the bodies were left lying naked upon the ground, having been stripped of their clothing by the Indians. These Indians had a two horse wagon, filled with something I could not see, as blankets were carefully spread over the top. The wagon was driven by a white man, and beside him, there were two or three Indians in it. Many of them had shawls, and hundreds of women's clothing were tied to their saddles. They were also supplied with guns or pistols, besides bows and arrows. The hindmost Indians were driving several head of the emigrant's cattle, Mr. Dame and Mr. Haight, and their men, seemed to be on the best of terms with the Indians and they were all in high spirits, as if they were mutually pleased with the accomplishment of some desired object. They thronged around us and greeted us with noisy cordiality. We did not learn much from them. They passed on and we drove all night in silence, and at daylight camped, and were told we were three miles beyond the scene of slaughter.

Mr. Powers and his train arrived at San Bernardino, and he was advised by Mr. Mathews, who, he learned, was a President or Elder in that place, not to associate with the damned apostates that they were cut-throats of the worst character. If he wished, they would give him constant work at their mill in the mountains, and he must be careful not to talk too much of what he had seen. When in San Bernardino, he heard many persons express gratification at the massacre. At the church services on Sunday, Capt. Hunt occupied the pulpit, and, among other things, he said that the hand of the Lord was in it; whether it was done by white or red skins, It was right! The prophesies concerning Missouri were being fulfilled, and they would all be accomplished. Mr. Mathews said the work had just begun, and it should be carried on until Uncle Sam and all his boys that were left should come to Zion and beg for bread.

WHEREAS, After a careful examination into all the circumstances connected with the late horrible massacre in Utah Territory, we firmly believe the atrocious act was perpetrated by the Mormons, and their allies, the Indians; and

WHEREAS, We, perceive the rapidly gathering clouds of trouble, caused by a long, undisturbed, systematized course of thefts, robberies and murders, promoted and sanctioned by their leader and head prophet, Brigham Young, together with the elders and followers of the Mormon Church, upon American citizens, whom necessity had compelled to pass through their Territory; aware of their bitter hostility to our Republican Government, and all its institutions; their rejection, insult, oppression; and in some cases murder, of the Federal officers, sent by the President to enforce the laws of the United States; believing that the late massacre in cold blood of one hundred and eighteen persons, included in which number were sixty women and children, is but a commencement of a series of such fiendish atrocities, that the many emigrant trains now on their way from the Western States to California, are liable to meet the same fate unless speedy measures are taken by the Government of the United States, the tide of emigration by this route will be entirely stopped.

Therefore be it Resolved, That we respectfully petition the President of the United States to exert the authority vested in him by the Constitution, that prompt measures may be taken for the punishment of the authors of the recent appalling and wholesale butchery of innocent women and children.

Resolved, That as there are at the present time a large community of Mormons residing in the adjoining county of San Bernardino, many of whom are living in open violation of one of the most important and sacred laws of our State.

Be it Resolved, That we hereby respectfully request the Chief Executive of this State enforce its laws upon the people.

Resolved, That we hold ourselves ready at all times to respond to the call of the proper authorities to assist, if necessary, in enforcing obedience to the laws.
