SPECIAL TO THE DESERET NEWS.
By Telegraph.
GENERAL.

NEW Yorkâ€”The fact that the Mountain Meadow massacre was Mormon work has been fully confirmed by the confession of Philip Klingan Smith, now of Lincoln Co., Nev. Smith says that at the time he was Mormon Bishop at Cedar City, Utah, and was forced to muster with the militia regiment for the perpetration of the crime; that the assailed party, after four days' fight, were induced to lay down their arms under promise of protection, after which all were shot down by the "Mormon" militia, except seventeen young children, who were taken in charge of by Smith and saved.
