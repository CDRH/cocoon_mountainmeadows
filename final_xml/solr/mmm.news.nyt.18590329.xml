From Salt Lake.   

St. Louis, Sunday, March 27.

We have advices from Salt Lake to the 15th ult.
The Indians in the vicinity of Santa Clara having
killed several white persons, Gov. CUMMING had
made a requisition upon Gov. JOHNSTON for troops to
chastise them.  Seventeen white children who were
captured by the Indians at the massacre eighteen
months ago at Mountain Meadows, when 140 emigrants
were murdered, have been recovered from 
their captors.
