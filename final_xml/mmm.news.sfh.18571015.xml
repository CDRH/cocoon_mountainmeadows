<head>The Emigrant Massacre.</head>

<salute>Editor of the San Francisco Herald&#8212;</salute></opener>

<p>I have just had a conversation with Mr. B., who has read a letter from <persName key="Hyde, William">Orson Hyde</persName>, received here the day before yesterday, (Oct. 7th,) from <placeName type="settlement" key="San Bernardino, CA">San Bernardino</placeName>, at which place  <persName key="Hyde, William">Hyde</persName> recently arrived, with an escort of thirty men, from <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake</placeName>, and where his letter was written to a fellow Mormon here, Mr. L. He writes, that he left <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake</placeName> just two days after the unfortunate emigrant train and passed that place, and overtook them in time to save <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">the children remaining alive &#8212; fifteen infants only</seg>; that <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Aftermath"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">the bodies of 118 persons, men, women, and children</seg>, were lying upon the ground, a prey to the buzzards</seg>, many of whom were of the "back out order," who had joined the California emigrant train for security in traveling.  <persName key="Hyde, William">Hyde</persName> writes, that <seg type="Source" subtype="WordofMouth">he learned from the settlers in the vicinity of the place of the massacre, that <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle"><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">the Indians</seg> fired upon the camp about two hours before day, killing a large number, and then retreated. The emigrants then formed a corral with their wagons, and at daylight the Indians returned to the attack. That the fight lasted "two days," when <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender">the emigrants sent out a little girl about twelve years old with a flag of surrender; <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">that she was killed, and the entire train destroyed</seg></seg>, <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Aftermath">leaving the bodies upon the ground</seg></seg></seg>, <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">which  <persName key="Hyde, William">Orson Hyde</persName> himself counted (118,)</seg> <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">he arriving at the spot just in time to gather up the fifteen infants, which he brought to San Bernardino.</seg>  <persName key="Hyde, William">Hyde</persName> is going directly back to <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake</placeName>, and takes, per <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName>'s instructions, a large number of Mormons with him. The recipient of this letters thinks the fate of the "back outs" just and merited. <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">My informant don't believe it was the Indians who killed the emigrants.</seg></p>
