<p><seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">This was obeyed. Some settlers stole into their camp by night to give them little comforts, and one man was cut off from the church for so doing.</seg> While the story was being told with entire accuracy, it was listened to breathlessly. He then detailed what he would show by witnesses. </p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Aftermath">The witnesses were then examined. <persName key="Keyes, H. H.">H.H. Keyes</persName>, who passed over the spot two weeks after the massacre, gave a vivid description of the pools of blood and <choice><sic>aol</sic></choice> bodies stripped naked, composed of <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">women and children.

<p>The council was composed of <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName>, <persName key="Higbee, John H.">Higbee</persName>, witness, <persName key="Allen, Ira">Allen</persName> and others. Opposition was made to it; witness was opposed; some favored it. The meeting broke up in confusion and went out of doors. On Monday the subject was again discussed and witness was again opposed to it. <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> sent witness and <persName key="White, Sam">Sam White</persName> to <placeName type="settlement" key="Pinto Creek, UT">Pinto Creek</placeName> to tell the people to let the emigrants pass; started in the afternoon, and saw <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> in a field. He asked where we were going; witness told him; <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> said I have something to say to that. The last witness saw of the train was at <placeName type="settlement" key="Iron Spring, UT">Iron Springs</placeName>, in the morning, as they were drawing out as we passed back. <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">There were between twenty-five to thirty wagons, and 100 or more people.</seg> <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Planning">Coming home the day following, I met <persName key="Allen, Ira">Ira Allen</persName>, who said the</seg></p>

Three days afterwards, <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> came to MacFarlands and said word had come in from camp last night; they had not got along as anticipated and wanted reinforcements. <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName> went to <placeName type="settlement" key="Parowan, UT">Parowan</placeName> to get instructions and there he received orders from <persName key="William H.

This was agreed upon and the execution of the plot intrusted to <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName>.</seg> The order was then given to march to the spring where the Indians and Southern soldiers were encamped; and when the company from <placeName type="county" key="Washington County, UT">Washington county</placeName> arrived there, <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> formed them into a battalion square and instructed the troops how to act; about fifty men were in line&#8212;not an Indian amongst them, witness and the old man were outside the line talking the matter over. It struck both as horrible and both opposed it; witness said what can we do? How can we help ourselves? <persName key="Slade">Slade</persName> said we canâ€™t resist; we were ordered to march down about one and one-half miles; Higbee and his officers took command; the organization was called</p>

We were protecting the emigrants; some expressed their thankfulness at being delivered from the Indians. We marched from a quarter to half a mile, and command was given to halt.
