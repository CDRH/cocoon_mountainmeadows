<p><seg type="Source" subtype="Reprinted">A letter <seg type="Source" subtype="Attributed_Christian">from <persName key="Christian, J. Ward">J. C. Ward</persName></seg> to the <orgName type="newspaper" key="Los Angeles Star">Los Angelos Star</orgName>, dated <placeName type="settlement" key="San Bernardino, CA">San Bernardino</placeName>, October 4th, 1857</seg>, states that an entire train of emigrants <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationMissouri">from <placeName type="state" key="Missouri">Missouri</placeName></seg> and <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas"><placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName></seg>, <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="Route">bound to <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName> by way of <geogName type="waterway" key="Great Salt Lake">Great Salt Lake</geogName></seg>, had been <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">massacred by Indians</seg> <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Location">at the <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">Mountain Meadows</geogName>, which are on or near the <geogName type="feature" key="Great Basin">rim of the Great Basin</geogName>, and some distance south of the most southern Mormon settlements</seg>.&#8212;  <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Dates">The massacre took place about the 10th or 11th of September.</seg>  <seg type="Source" subtype="Indians">Mr. <persName key="Christian, J. Ward">Ward</persName> says he first obtained his information from the Indians.</seg>  The account is as follows:</p>
    
<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">The company consisted of one hundred and thirty or one hundred and thirty-five men, women and children, and included some forty or forty-five capable of bearing arms.</seg> <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">They were in possession of quite an amount of stock, consisting of horses, mules, oxen.</seg>  <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Dates">The encampment was attacked about daylight in the morning</seg>, so say the Indians, by the combined forces of all the various tribes immediately in the section of the country.  It appears that <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">the majority of them were slain at the first onset made by the Indians</seg></seg>.</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">The remaining force formed themselves into the best position their circumstances would allow; but before they could make the necessary arrangements for protecting themselves from the arrows there were but few left who were able to bear arms.</seg></seg></p>
    
<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">After having corralled their wagons, and dug a ditch for their protection, they continued to fire upon the Indians for one or two days; but the Indians had so secreted themselves that, according to their own statement, their was not one of them killed, and but few wounded.</seg>  <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Surrender"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">They (the emigrants) then sent a flag of truce, borne by a little girl, and gave themselves up to the mercy of the savages,</seg> who immediately rushed in and slaughtered all of them,</seg> with the exception of <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">fifteen infant children, that has since been purchased with difficulty by the Mormon interpreters.</seg></p>
    
<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="EmigrantBehavior">The causes which let to the massacre are reported to be that, when the train camped at an Indian village near <placeName type="settlement" key="Fillmore City, UT">Fillmore city</placeName>, <seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeIndian">the emigrants not only cheated the natives badly in trading with them</seg>, but <seg type="Encounter" subtype="Poison">they put strychnine in a dead ox for the purpose of poisoning the Indians, and also put poison in the water which stands in pools.  This occasioned several deaths among the Indians, within a few days after the departure of the train</seg>; whereupon the Indians rallied, selected a place of attack, and took terrible vengeance.</seg>  Mr. <persName key="Christian, J. Ward">W.</persName> says he obtained a statement of the causes of the massacre form Elders <persName key="Mathews, William">Mathews</persName> and <persName key="Hyde, Bill">Hyde</persName>, who were in <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City">Great Salt Lake City</placeName> at the time this train was there recruiting their fit out, and were on their way to <placeName type="settlement" key="San Bernardino, CA">San Bernardino</placeName> when the murders were committed, but several dayâ€™s journey in the rear of the emigrants.</p>
