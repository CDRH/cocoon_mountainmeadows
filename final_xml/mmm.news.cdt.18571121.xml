<head>The Mormon Outrages.</head>

<opener>
<dateline>WASHINGTON, Nov. 19.</dateline></opener>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence"><seg type="Source" subtype="WordofMouth">I learn from an intelligent gentleman who has spent two or three years among Salt Lake Mormons</seg>, a fact or two tending to confirm the suspicion that the recent terrible massacre of <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">over 100 California emigrants</seg> by Santa Clara Indians, was perpetrated under the influence of the Mormon leaders.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="GunnisonMurder"><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">It is evident that the savages who perpetrated this outrage are the same band who cut off <persName key="Gunnison, John Williams">Capt. Gunnison</persName> and his command, for they are the only band of Indians at <geogName type="waterway" key="Corn Creek">Corn Creek</geogName> who raise grain and have it to sell. They are the same also who a year or more ago came very near massacreing <persName key="Hunt">Dr. Hunt</persName>, the U. S. Indian Agent, <persName key="Burr">Mr. Burr</persName>, U. S. Surveyor General and party, at the suggestion of Mormon emissaries who rode into the Indian village a few miles ahead of them and announced that the Indian agent and his friends were coming to arrest and punish them for <persName key="Gunnison, John Williams">Gunnison</persName>'s murder. On that occasion, fortunately, they were accompanied the war chief of a neighboring friendly tribe, who succeeded, with difficulty, to satisfying the Indians that they were on a friendly visit.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">I learn also that <persName key="Hickman, William">Bill Hickman</persName> and <persName key="Smith, Lat">Lat Smith</persName>, erroneously published Locksmith, who headed the party which recently destroyed the train containing supplies for the troops on their way to Utah, are two of the most notorious leaders of the Mormon Danite Band or destroying <choice><sic>Angles</sic><corr>Angels</corr></choice>.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="LDSPersecution">There is reason to believe that <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> has fully made up his mied that be must leave <placeName type="state" key="Utah">Utah</placeName> next spring. It seems that part of the mission to England of <persName key="Pratt, Orson">Elder Orson Pratt</persName> and <persName key="Beson, Ezra F.">Ezra F. Benson</persName>, who is still abroad, was, to seek from the British Government permission to settle in the British Possession;. The application was refused.</seg></p>
