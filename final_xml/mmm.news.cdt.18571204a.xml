<head>Terrible Massacre of Emigrants by the Mormons and Indians.</head>

<p>Elsewhere we publish late and exciting news from <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName>, in regard <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">the massacre of 120 American emigrants</seg> who were <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="Route">crossing the plains en route to <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName></seg>. <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansLDSInfluence">The actual perpetrators of the massacre were no doubt Indians; but the suspicion is, that they were encouraged, instigated, and perhaps led on by Mormons.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">The party in question is said to have consisted of <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">about 135 men, women and children, including some forty or forty-five capable of bearing-arms</seg>. <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils"><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas">They were from <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName></seg>, were well provided, and had with them quite a stock of horses, mules, and oxen.</seg></seg> <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="Route">They had traveled across the plains by the way of <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Great Salt Lake City</placeName>, on their way to Southern <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName>, and had reached <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Location">the rim of the great basin,</seg> about three hundred miles south-west of the <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Great Salt Lake city</placeName>, and fifty miles from <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName>, the most southerly of the Mormon settlements in <placeName type="state" key="Utah">Utah</placeName>,</seg> <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Battle">when they were attacked and all destroyed,</seg> <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">with the exception of fifteen young children, who were afterward bought from the Indians by the Mormons.</seg> What we know of this affair, <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Dates">which seems to have taken place about the 10th or 11th of September</seg>, <seg type="Source" subtype="WordofMouth">is derived from statements made by the <orgName type="religious" key="Church of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints">Mormons</orgName> as to what they had learned about it from the <orgName type="native" key="Indians">Indians</orgName>, and from the statements of another party of emigrants who had subsequently passed over the same route, having left <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName> ten days later.&#8211;</seg>&#8212;<seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">Suspicion would seem, however, to rest rather upon the extremely bad state of feeling which prevails between the Mormons and emigrants through their country&#8212;and which, in the case of this particular train, would seem to have been especially bitter&#8212;than upon any facts positively known.</seg></p>
