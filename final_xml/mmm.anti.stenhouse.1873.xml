<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain"><hi rend="smallcaps">A FEW</hi> weeks in advance of the United States Expedition to <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> in 1857, there were two trains of emigrants <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="Route">crossing the plains with the purpose of going to southern <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName></seg>. The <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationMissouri">one was from <placeName type="state" key="Missouri">Missouri</placeName></seg>, <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas">the other from <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName></seg>. The former was composed chiefly of men who named themselves "Missouri Wild-cats;" the other train was a company of highly-respectable persons, sober and orderly, and in their associations seemed like a large gathering of kindred, or very near friends. The first were probably venturous spirits seeking fortune; the others, citizens seeking new homes.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">The latter company was wealthy, and there were around them every indication of comfort, and everything in abundance for pleasant travelling. In addition to the ordinary transportation wagons of emigrants, they had several riding carriages, which betokened the social class of life in which some of the emigrants had moved before setting out on the adventure of western colonization.</seg></seg></p>

<pb n="427" xml:id="mmm.anti.stenhouse.1873.462"/>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">They were in no hurry, but travelled leisurely, with the view of nursing the strength of their <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Spoils">cattle, horses, and mules</seg>, in order to accomplish successfully the long and tedious journey which they had undertaken. In that company there were <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">men, women, and children, of every age, from the venerable patriarch to the baby in arms.</seg> It was a bevy of families related to each other by the ties of consanguinity and marriage, with here and there in the train a neighbour who desired to share with them the chances of fortune in the proposed new homes on the golden shores of the Pacific.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">One of their number had been a Methodist preacher, and probably most of the adults were members of that denomination. They were moral in language and conduct, and united regularly in morning and evening prayers.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">On Sundays they did not travel, but observed it as a day of sacred rest for man and beast. At the appointed hour of service, this brother-preacher assembled his fellow-travellers in a large tent, which served as a meetingâ€”house, within their wagon-circled camp, for the usual religious exercises, and there, on the low, boundless prairies, or in higher altitudes at the base of snow-capped mountains, he addressed them as fervently, and with as much soul-inspiring faith, as if his auditory had been seated comfortably within the old church-walls at home, and they too sang their hymns of praise with grateful, feeling souls, and with hearts impressed with the realization that man was but a speck in the presence of that grand and limitless nature that surrounded them, and of which they were but a microscopic part.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">Those who passed the company <hi rend="italic">en route</hi>, or travelled with
them a part of the way, were favourably impressed with their society, and spoke of them in the kindest terms as an exceedingly fine company of emigrants, such as was seldom seen on the plains.</seg></p>

<p>Though utterly unlike themselves in character and disposition, the "Wild-cats" contracted for them much respect, and came as near to them in travelling as was convenient for the grazing of the cattle and the purposes of the camp at night. Within sight of each other they would form their corrals, but, while the one resounded with vulgar song, boisterous roaring,

<pb n="428" xml:id="mmm.anti.stenhouse.1873.463"/>

and "tall swearing," in the other there was the peace of domestic bliss and conscious rectitude.</p>

<p><seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain">A gentleman, a friend of the Author, travelled with this <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName> company from Fort Bridger to <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>, and speaks of them in the highest terms: he never travelled with more pleasant companions. Hearing the nightly yells of the "Wild-cats," he advised the <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName> company to separate from them as much as possible while passing through the settlements, and in going through the Indian country and so much was this gentleman impressed with the necessity of great prudence on the part of the emigrants that, after he had left them on his arrival at <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>, he afterwards returned and impressed upon the leading men the urgency of refusing to travel further with the <placeName type="state" key="Missouri">Missouri</placeName> company so near to them. The kindly suggestions were appreciated, and they expressed their desire to act upon them. Up to this time the journey of the emigrants had been prosperous, and everything bade fair for a pleasant termination of their travels. Like all other pilgrims, they had counted upon replenishing their stock of provisions at <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>, and to do this, and to rest their cattle, they concluded to camp awhile by the Jordan.</seg></p>

<p>In early times of overland travel, the arrival of a Gentile emigrant train was usually a pleasant season for trade and barter, and those who thought proper to visit the camp could readily exchange the fruits of the garden and the produce of the dairy or the field for tea, coffee, sugar, and similar  useful articles, which the emigrants had in greater abundance. Many a sister in <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName> has bedecked herself with apparel advantageously purchased from the passers-by with the eggs and butter she had accumulated for just such an opportunity.</p>

<p>But a change had come over the spirit of the people in 1857. <seg type="Context" subtype="UtahWar">The Federal troops were advancing upon Zion, and the Saints were preparing for the defence of their homes. The Indian is not the only human being who fails to discriminate between the innocent and the guilty.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="MissouriWildCats"><seg type="Context" subtype="LDSPersecution"><seg type="Blame" subtype="EmigrantBehavior">Since that date it has been frequently asserted by the <choice><orig>Mor-

<pb n="429" xml:id="mmm.anti.stenhouse.1873.464"/>

mon</orig><reg>Mormon</reg></choice> preachers that some of the <placeName type="state" key="Missouri">Missouri</placeName> company had boasted on the way that they had taken part in driving the Mormons from that State, and they are also said to have expressed their joy at the approach of the United States army to "wipe out the Mormons," and adding to that folly that they themselves would willingly assist in such a pleasant work.</seg></seg></seg> The alleged animus against the other company can be briefly told.</p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="PrattMurder">About twelve months preceding that time one of the
Apostles, <persName key="Pratt, Parley P.">Parley P. Pratt</persName>, had been arraigned at Fort Smith,
<placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName>, on a charge of abducting the children of one <persName key="McLean, Hector">Hector McLean</persName>, of <placeName type="settlement" key="New Orleans, LA">New Orleans</placeName>, and trying to run them off to <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>.
The mother of the children had years before become converted to the Mormon faith in <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName>, and subsequently became one of the Mrs. P. P. Pratt in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>. This apostle had not, at this time, been to <placeName type="settlement" key="New Orleans, LA">New Orleans</placeName>, and he personally did not abduct the children: of the act direct he was guiltless, but he was to meet with Mrs. <persName key="McLean Pratt, Eleanor">McLean Pratt</persName> in <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName> while she was <hi rend="italic">en route</hi> from <placeName type="settlement" key="New Orleans, LA">New Orleans</placeName> to <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>. Of that <persName key="McLean, Hector">Hector McLean</persName> became assured, and he started "upon their trail."</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="PrattMurder">At the examination before a magistrate, <persName key="McLean Pratt, Eleanor">Mrs. McLean Pratt</persName>assumed all the responsibility for the abduction of the children, and the apostle was honourably discharged. His friends, however, apprehended danger, and advised him to escape, if he could, for <persName key="McLean, Hector">McLean</persName> was a violent man. Those who proffered this advice also offered him a brace of revolvers for his defence, but the apostle refused the carnal weapons, and preferred, on this occasion, to leave "his life in the protection of the Lord."</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="PrattMurder">In such a sparsely-settled country the escape of the apostle was impossible. In a few hours <persName key="McLean, Hector">McLean</persName> was certain to overtake him wherever he went. At length he came within sight of his enemy, as he regarded the apostle, and hotly pursued him with a thirst for blood. Hoping for some possible shelter, Mr. <persName key="Pratt, Parley P.">Pratt</persName> made some <hi rend="italic">d&#233;tour</hi> from the public road, but it served him nothing, for <persName key="McLean, Hector">McLean</persName> reached him before he could arrive at the house where he thought to take refuge. Following him closely, he emptied his revolver at the apostle, but failed to touch him. He became much enraged, urged forward his horse, and, as he rode past him, made a lunge with a bowie-knife, and gave him a fatal thrust in the side. The wounded

<pb n="430" xml:id="mmm.anti.stenhouse.1873.465"/>

man instantly fell from his horse, and <persName key="McLean, Hector">McLean</persName>, with a Derringer that he obtained from one who accompanied him, fired again at his victim as he lay bleeding on the ground. That ball penetrated his breast, and in a few hours later the apostle <persName key="Pratt, Parley P.">Parley P. Pratt</persName> was dead.</seg>*</p>

<p><seg type="Context" subtype="PrattMurder"><persName key="McLean, Hector">McLean</persName> returned to Fort Smith, walked through the town with his friends, and in the evening took the passing steamer for the South. No one seemed to think that he should be arrested; Mormonism and apostles were unpopular. Whether with justice in this case or not, there is always a feeling of sympathy for the injured when domestic intrusions are before the public.</seg></p>

<p>A contributor to the <placeName type="settlement" key="Corinne, UT">Corinne</placeName> <hi rend="italic">Reporter</hi>, a Gentile paper published about sixty miles north of <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>, recently published a series of "open letters" addressed to <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham
Young</persName>, in which there is much light thrown upon the terrible fate of <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">the two emigrant companies</seg> from <placeName type="state" key="Missouri">Missouri</placeName> and 
<placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName>. The writer of the letters signed himself "Argus,"&#8224;
and, for prudential reasons, has withheld his name from the public.</p>

<p>As this gentleman relates with minuteness of detail the circumstances preceding the massacre, and also gives a thrilling picture of that dreadful deed, the Author avails himself of the courtesy by which he has been permitted to make such extracts as were necessary to tell the story of the Mountain Meadows Massacre: only prefacing these extracts with the statement that the charges as to the author of the order for

<note type="footnote">* <seg type="Context" subtype="PrattMurder">It has often been charged to <persName key="Pratt, Parley P.">Parley</persName> that he seduced Mrs. <persName key="McLean Pratt, Eleanor">McLean</persName> from her husband. Mrs. <persName key="McLean Pratt, Eleanor">McLean</persName> asserts to the contrary.</seg></note>

<note type="footnote">&#8224; As no statements of such importance as those made by this writer could possibly be cited in a work of this kind without knowing who he was, and whether he was likely to be in possession of the information that he claimed to know, for some months the Author sought anxiously, but ineffectually, to discover the writer's name; the publisher very properly concealed it. At an unlooked-for moment the thread was accidentally found, and "Argus" frankly avowed that he wrote the "open letters," and assured the Author that before a Federal court of justice, where he could be protected, he was prepared to give the evidence of all that he had asserted. It need only be added that "Argus" has probably been for thirty years a Mormon, has resided many years in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, has been a high-priest in the church, and has held responsible civil positions in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">the Territory</placeName>.</note>

the massacre, and the deductions of the writer against <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName>, have been nearly all left out: first, and principally, for brevityâ€™s sake, and secondly, from the consideration that, on so serious a charge as wholesale murder, the unconvicted should have, as before expressed, the benefit of whatever uncertainty there is about the matter. There is, however, sufficient extracted to make it very desirable for <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> to encourage the investigation of these charges before a competent tribunal, to clear his name of the imputation&#8212;if he is innocent.</p>

<p>"SIR: <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="WagonTrain"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Casualties">The company of emigrants slaughtered</seg> <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Dates">on the 15th of September, 1857</seg>, <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Location">at <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">the Mountain Meadows</geogName></seg>, and within your jurisdiction, was one of the wealthiest, most respectable and peaceable that ever crossed the continent by the way of <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>. They were American citizens&#8212;were within the territory of the United States, and when they encamped by the Jordan river, upon the free, unenclosed and unappropriated public domain, and by the laws of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, their stock were 'free commoners' on that domain. The most of those emigrants had unquestionably been farmers, all of them rural in their habits of life; and from the fact that you did not charge them with being thieves, or robbers, or of trespassing upon the rights of others, or disturbing the public peace, or with behaving themselves unseemly, it is fair to infer that they were as upright and virtuous in their habits of thought, and as honest and honourable in their intercourse with others as people from country parts generally are. <seg type="Emigrants" subtype="StateAffiliationArkansas">They came from <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName>.</seg></seg>*</p>

<p>"When they encamped by the Jordan they were weary and foot-sore, their supply of food was wellnigh exhausted, and their work-cattle nearly 'used up' by the labours of the long and toilsome journey. The necessity rested upon them of tarrying in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> sufficiently long to rest and recruit their teams and replenish their store of provisions. The harvest in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> that year, then gathering, was abundant, and mountain and valley were covered with rich and nutritious grasses. What was there to hinder this company from staying as long as they pleased, recruiting their stock, and pursuing their journey when they got ready? And, besides, what had they done that the protection of the law, represented in your person, should be worse than withdrawn from them? that they should be ordered to break up camp and move on? and, worse than all, that a courier should be sent ahead of them bearing your written instructions to the Mormons on said company's line of travel to have no dealing or intercourse with

<note type="footnote">* <persName key="McLean Pratt, Eleanor">Mrs. McLean Pratt</persName> is said to have recognized one or more of the emigrants as being present at the murder of the apostle.</note>

<pb n="432" xml:id="mmm.anti.stenhouse.1873.467"/>

them; thus compelling them to almost certain death by starvation on the deserts? You were at that time the Governor of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, Commander-in-Chief of the militia, and Superintendent of Indian Affairs, a sworn officer of the United States and of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">the Territory</placeName>, upon whom devolved, and with whom were intrusted grave and important responsibilities, affecting the liberties of the people, the rights of persons and property, and the welfare and happiness of all within the pale of your authority without regard to sect, creed, name, or nativity, or differences between individual opinions. In addition to your magistrature, you were the chief high-priest of almost the entire body of the people, assuming to yourself extraordinary heavenly powers and an unusual amount of spiritual excellence. Without any modification of the term, you were professedly the earthly Vicar of the heavenly Saviour&#8212;of Him who divinely discoursed on earth of mercy and of love, and whose last words were, 'Father, forgive them!'. . .</p>

<p><seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">"Not being allowed to remain, this weary, unrested company 'broke camp' and took up their line of travel for <placeName type="settlement" key="Los Angeles, CA">Los Angeles</placeName>. Their progress was necessarily slow. Arriving at American Fork settlement they essayed to trade off some of their worn-out stock for the fresh and reliable cattle of the Mormons, offering fine bargains; and also sought to buy provisions. What must have been their surprise when they found they could do neither? Notwithstanding that flour, bacon, vegetables in variety, poultry, butter, cheese, eggs, etc., were in unusual abundance, and plenty of surplus stock, not the first thing could be bought or sold! They passed on through <placeName type="settlement" key="Battle Creek, UT">Battle Creek</placeName>, <placeName type="settlement" key="Provo, UT">Provo</placeName>, <placeName type="settlement" key="Springville, UT">Springville</placeName>, <placeName type="settlement" key="Spanish Fork, UT">Spanish Fork</placeName>, <placeName type="settlement" key="Payson, UT">Payson</placeName>, <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Creek, UT">Salt Creek</placeName> and <placeName type="settlement" key="Fillmore, UT">Fillmore</placeName>, attempting at each settlement to purchase food and to trade for stock, but without success. It is true that occasionally some Mormon more daring than his fellows would sack up a few pounds of provisions, and under cover of night smuggle the same into the emigrant camp, taking his chances of a severed windpipe in satisfaction for such unreasonable contempt of orders; but otherwise there was no food bought by this company thus far. And here it is worthy to remark that up to this time no complaint had been made against these travellers. They had been accused of no crime known to the laws, and, undeniably, it had been a point with them to quietly and peaceably pass through <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, in the hope of reaching some Gentile settlement where their gold and cattle could buy them something to eat.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">"The query arises here, What caused so strange and unprecedented a proceeding towards this particular company? The custom of the overland emigration at that time was well known; which was, to provision their trains for <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>, and refit at that place for <placeName type="state" key="California">California</placeName>. If other trains could rest and recruit, could buy, sell and refit in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, why not this? . . . These people were from <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName>, a State in which  <persName key="Pratt, Parley P.">Parley P. Pratt</persName>, one of your fellow-apostles, had been killed . . . But to return. This ill-fated company were now at <placeName type="settlement" key="Fillmore, UT">Fillmore</placeName>. They had left their camp at the Jordan with almost empty wagons, they had been unable to purchase provisions, as before stated, they had but three or four <choice><orig>settle-

<pb n="433" xml:id="mmm.anti.stenhouse.1873.468"/>

What their prospects, feelings and forebodings were at that time, I leave for your consideration; but, sir, I beg to call your attention to the fact that, at the capture of their train at <geogName type="valley" key="Mountain Meadows">the Mountain Meadows</geogName>, their stores were found to be inadequate for the journey in contemplation. They were, indeed, wellnigh exhausted, with the exception of two purchases which I shall describe presently, which purchases were made after they had left <placeName type="settlement" key="Fillmore, UT">Fillmore</placeName>. There cannot be a reasonable doubt that they were already on short allowance when they reached that settlement. . . . There have been times, as in late occurrences in Paris, when men's passions have been aroused and excited, especially upon religious differences, and still more especially when associated with the idea of caste or race; outrages and wholesale butcheries have occurred; but here we have in free America a peaceable company of emigrants who were forced untimely into a journey, then half-starved, and finally slaughtered in cold blood! And this was the result of the apparent action of an entire people. Do you expect the world to believe that action to have been spontaneous with them? That the whole people from the Jordan to <placeName type="settlement" key="Fillmore, UT">Fillmore</placeName> should, of their own free will, uninfluenced, uninstructed, uncoerced, should all as one unite in denying these strangers the right even of buying food? Impossible! This company of <placeName type="state" key="Arkansas">Arkansas</placeName> farmers, travelling with their wives and little ones, had now travelled through and by fifteen different settlements, large and small, peopled by Mormons under your absolute control in all things, and had not been able to buy food. Oh! what a falling off was there from the words of Him who said, 'If thine enemy hunger, feed him!' . . . . . . .</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeIndian">"At <placeName type="settlement" key="Fillmore, UT">Fillmore</placeName> their store of provisions was too scanty to allow of delay; and so soon as they found they could do no trading there they moved on, and in due course reached Corn Creek. Here they saw the first kindly look and heard the first friendly word since they left the Jordan. And, strange to say, those friends were Indians! They sold the emigrants 30 bushels of corn&#8212;all they had to spare&#8212;and sent them away in peace.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Encounter" subtype="TradeLDS">"The company passed on from Corn Creek, and, reaching <placeName type="settlement" key="Beaver, UT">Beaver</placeName>, they found the same order of non-intercourse, the same prohibition as to trading as before; and, passing on, they came to <placeName type="settlement" key="Parowan, UT">Parowan</placeName>, <hi rend="italic">but were not permitted to enter the town</hi>. Now be it known, and the books will show, that the General Government had paid twenty-five thousand dollars in gold coin for the surveying and opening of this road which passed directly through the town of <placeName type="settlement" key="Parowan, UT">Parowan</placeName>, and upon which this company was travelling and had travelled all the way from <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>, passing through American Fork, and all the principal settlements on the route. They had passed through those settlements without let or hindrance; but here they were forced to leave the public highway and pass around the west side of the fort wall. When they reached the stream abreast of the town

<pb n="434" xml:id="mmm.anti.stenhouse.1873.469"/>

they encamped, and tried, as before, to trade for food and fresh cattle, but failed. There was a little Englishman who was determined to sell them some provisions; but Bishop Lewis's son and Counsellor advanced before him, and, pressing the edge of a bowie-knife against his throat, compelled him to retreat without realizing his humane intentions. There was a grist-mill at <placeName type="settlement" key="Parowan, UT">Parowan</placeName>, the first the company had 'struck' since they left Corn Creek. They made application to have the corn ground which they had bought of the Indians, but were flatly refused.</seg></p>

<p>"Now, sir, why were these emigrants refused permission to enter and pass through <placeName type="settlement" key="Parowan, UT">Parowan</placeName>?

<p>To this letter no reply was vouchsafed.</p>

<p>Whatever differences of opinion may exist between former members of the Church and the Prophet, no proper-minded person among them desires to see any wrong imputed to <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> of which he is innocent; and of the responsibility of this massacre, above all other things, his bitterest enemy should be pleased to see him exonerated.</p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS"><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently">The apostles who have spoken and written upon this painful subject, have endeavoured to fasten the guilt solely upon the Indians, but this was a grave error, as well as being directly and palpably false.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS"><seg type="Reaction" subtype="Silence">There is implanted in the human breast an instinctive horror of the act of murder, and a large number of the Mormons who took part in the massacre were too good men to rest in peace after the commission of a dreadful deed that was forced upon them. It has unmistakably withered and blasted their happiness, and some of them have suffered agonizing tortures of conscience, equal to those of Shakespeare's Thane of Cawdor. Two of them are said to have lost their reason entirely, and others have gone to early graves with a full realization of the terrible crime upon their souls. To expect silence among the living while such a deed was consuming them was a great folly, and the exposure in detail now coming to light is what every sensible man might have expected some time or other.</seg></seg></p>

It might be proper here to remark, that the Indians in the southern part of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">the Territory of Utah</placeName> are not numerous, and are a very low, cowardly, beastly set, very few of them being armed with guns.

It was on the north side of this spring that the emigrants camped. The bank rises from the spring eight or ten feet, then extends off to the north about two hundred yards, on a level. A range of hills is there reached, rising perhaps fifty or sixty feet.

the civil power created expressly for the protection of life and property, is a mystery which the purely American mind finds very hard to understand. And the marvel is only increased by the fact that no inquest was held over the remains of those slaughtered ones&#8212;that no arrests were made of the murderers, although they were well and notoriously known,
and that no official notice was taken of the matter (except as I have  heretofore stated) during the remainder of your term as Governor, and no apparent authoritative notice since, except to gather up, by soldiers of the United States, <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Aftermath">what bones the wolves had left, and giving them respectable sepulture.</seg> Based upon American ideas, and, indeed, upon the more general notions of civilization, the whole story becomes incomprehensible.
In order to understand this matter, it will be necessary for the reader, first, to mentally segregate <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> geographically from the United States&#8212; to consider it as absolutely a foreign State and nation, with a civilization such as existed thirty-five hundred years ago, and a religion as  antagonistic to Christianity as Moslemism itself, including within its creed a tenet more cruel and bloody than the Thuggism of India. Second, to consider this Deseret nation as incensed to the last degree against the Government and people of the United States, for a series of wrongs committed against them, including exile and the loss of life and property. <seg type="Context" subtype="UtahWar">Third, to take into the account, that the American Government at that time had actually proposed to extend its jurisdiction over said Deseret (otherwise called <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>), and an army was then on its way to occupy said <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> for the purpose of maintaining the sovereignty of said Government there, and that a state of war was apparently existing between said two nations.

of the United States, under Colonel <persName key="Johnston, Albert Sidney">Johnston</persName>, then <hi rend="italic">en route</hi> for <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake</placeName>. Fifth, that you were the 'Sovereign' lord of Deseret&#8212;that your rule was an absolute and unmitigated despotism&#8212;that your word was the only recognized law&#8212;that it was within your imperious nature to rule with a high hand and a stretched-out arm over all your subjects, and with fury poured out against your enemies.</seg> If the reader can grasp the ideas contained in the above items, and arrange them into one compound proposition, he will be able to form some idea of the causes which made the aforesaid massacre possible.</p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">"But the misfortune is, that said proposition being based upon falsehood and not upon the truth, affords you no justification whatever; for, <seg type="Context" subtype="UtahWar">first, <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> was a part of the United States, and not a foreign State; second, your intense hatred of Americans and their Government was without adequate cause; third, the occupation of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> as a Military Department was altogether a friendly act, and in strict accordance with the known military policy of the Government; fourth, that all your acts in relation to the State of Deseret were and are treasonable in their intent, and therefore illegal and of no binding force.</seg> For these reasons, the American people will refuse to look upon that massacre from your stand-point. They will and do hold you to your responsibility as a citizen of the Republic. And as you were at that time the Chief Magistrate of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, they have the right to demand why you took no official steps to inquire into that sanguinary affair which is <hi rend="italic">the shame and damning disgrace of your administration</hi>. They have the right to demand why you took no official action in the case of <persName key="Dame, William H.">Dame</persName>, <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName>, and <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName>; and how it is that you have so far persistently and successfully screened those murderers from the officers and the action of the law. It is a foul blot upon the workings of the system of American jurisprudence that the Mountain Meadow Massacre should having been committed <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Dates">nearly sixteen years ago</seg>, and to this present writing you, and <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName>, and <persName key="Dame, William H.">Dame</persName>, and <persName key="Haight, Isaac C.">Haight</persName>, are at large, and come and go unquestioned by the proper authority. <seg type="Reaction" subtype="StateInvestigation">The blush of shame should mantle the cheeks of the Governor of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">our Territory</placeName> so long as that bloody affair remains uninvestigated, now that such investigation is possible.</seg> The judges of our courts should not have the courage to look a law-abiding man in the face so long as anything remains undone which they can legally do to bring those murderers to justice.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Reaction" subtype="StateInvestigation"><seg type="Reaction" subtype="FederalInvestigation">"It appears to have all along been the opinion that the investigation of the Mountain Meadow Massacre must originate in the criminal courts. With that view, and the Grand Jury subject to your dictation, and under your complete control, what could be done? Nothing, absolutely nothing, but to wait. Murder is shielded by no statute of limitations. But I will here suggest, that such investigation should be made by a military court, for the reason that the operations of <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> were purely and undeniably of a military character. Such a court would officially determine the military character of those operations, would collect all necessary facts in the case, and those facts would fix the responsibility where it justly <choice><orig>be-

If there are not Gentile officers enough in the <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> militia to constitute such a court, enough can soon be commissioned. But no Mormon should be allowed to constitute a part of that court, nor any Gentile who could be allured from duty by your sirens or be purchased by your ill-gotten gold.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Reaction" subtype="StateInvestigation"><seg type="Reaction" subtype="FederalInvestigation">"And now, in conclusion, as a Mormon, I demand of the proper authorities  that this long-neglected affair be investigated, in order that the innocent may no longer suffer that reproach which belongs to <persName key="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</persName> and others only. In this connection it is proper to state that there is a strong and growing feeling in Southern <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> against <persName key="Lee, John D.">Lee</persName> and his co-labourers on that bloody mission, and against their confederates, apologists, and protectors. Even in <placeName type="settlement" key="Cedar City, UT">Cedar City</placeName> those characters are now known as 'Mountain Meadow Dogs.' As a citizen of the United States, I demand that the veil of mystery so long covering that butchery be rent asunder, and the foul deed exposed in all its repulsive hideousness, bringing to the light those latent agencies which superinduced its commission, in order that justice may be meted out to the guilty parties, thus wiping out a foul blot upon the American name. In the name of Justice I  demand it, that it may no longer be said that in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> the direst of felonies may be committed with impunity. In the name of Truth, I demand that the facts concerning the Mountain Meadow Massacre be ascertained and stated in official form by competent authority, in order that the people of the United States may know that said massacre, even to its most sickening details, was only too true."</seg></seg></p>

<p>There are many incidental circumstances in the story of this massacre, and events which have occurred since its perpetration, that keenly touch the souls of those who are capable of appreciating the facts of that horrible tragedy.</p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">Judge <persName key="Cradlebaugh, John">Cradlebaugh</persName> speaks of the joy which he witnessed among the children when they found themselves together again, and under the protection of American citizens:</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">"I recollect," he says, "one of them, <persName key="Sorrow, John Calvin">John Calvin Sorrow</persName>, after he found he was safe, and before he was brought away from <placeName type="settlement" key="Salt Lake City, UT">Salt Lake City</placeName>, although not yet nine years of age, sitting in a contemplative mood, no doubt thinking of the extermination of his family, saying: <seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS">'Oh, I wish I was a man; I know what I would do; I would shoot <persName key="Lee, John D.">John D.

the company from Fort Bridger, speaks of her as a lovely, sweet creature, with dark flowing curls, who had been the life and joy of the camp, and the companion of the venerable patriarch of the company. When the first volley of rifles had strewn the ground with the dead, she flew into the arms of young <persName key="Lee, ">Lee</persName>, and begged protection of her life. The manly instinct of the youth was instantly aroused by the supplicating look of that pure and innocent being, in her defence, and he sheltered her by his person. In an instant <persName key="Lee, John D.">his father</persName> seized him by the collar, and by greater force bending his son's head, fired his revolver, and shot the maiden in the forehead. She fell lifeless at his feet.</seg> This incident, and the forced part which he played in the massacre, has blighted for ever the life of the young man, and to his confidants he has sorrowfully related his poignant grief.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">Three of the men who escaped from the massacre were pursued for a long distance. One of them is said to have perished in the desert, after a flight of one hundred and fifty miles; and of the disposition of the other two, the band under the captaincy of <persName key="Hatch, Ira">Ira Hatch</persName> could probably tell a thrilling story.</seg></p>

<p><seg type="Blame" subtype="LDS_LDS"><seg type="Massacre" subtype="Planning">There is, too, a legend that the written order for the massacre of the emigrants has been preserved, and is to-day in safe-keeping. If such a document does exist, it can only be in the hands of some one who means to use it at a proper time, but to acknowledge now the personal possession of such property would be dangerous folly. There are, however, persons in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> who are fully confident that the document is a  reality.</seg></seg></p>

<p><seg type="Reaction" subtype="Extra-legalViolence">Wherever the story of this treacherous massacre has gone forth, a curse has been muttered by the lips of honest men and women, and a demand for retribution has lingered on their tongues</seg>, <seg type="Reaction" subtype="FederalInvestigation">while, humiliating as it is to confess, in the Forty-second Congress there were gentlemen to be found in the Committees of the House, and in the Senate, who were bold enough to declare their opposition to all investigation of these murders. One who had a national reputation during the war, from Bunker's Hill to <placeName type="settlement" key="New Orleans, LA">New Orleans</placeName>, was not ashamed to say to those who sought the legislation that was necessary to make investigation possible, that it was "too late."</seg> To the petitioner he said:</p>

<pb n="457" xml:id="mmm.anti.stenhouse.1873.494"/>

<p>"Have any murders been committed in <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> during twenty years?"</p>

<p>"Yes.'</p>

<p>"Have any been committed during the last fifteen years?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have any been committed within ten years?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have any been committed within five years?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not."</p>

<p><seg type="Reaction" subtype="Silence">"Well, then," was the reply, "if there have been none within five years, I am opposed to meddling with the past.  There are murders in <placeName type="settlement" key="New York, NY">New York</placeName> nearly every day."</seg></p>

<p>To that representative from the proudest State in the Union, the answer of the fatherless should be, that one single murder resulting from religious hatred, systematically shown, is more damning than ten thousand murders, the casual offspring of the vile passions of the most debased of men.</p>

<p>Moreover, that a sedate, honourable Senator, also one who has not deemed the Presidency of the United States beneath his ambition, should make a similar announcement, and ask that the past might be buried in oblivion, is passing strange.*</p>

<p>To this lengthy statement, and circumstantial detail of facts, the Mormon apostles may continue, as they have done before, <seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently"><seg type="Blame" subtype="EmigrantBehavior"><seg type="Encounter" subtype="Poison">to allege that the emigrants put poison on the body of a dead ox, that some Indian chiefs partook of the poisoned meat and died, and that the rest of the Indians became enraged, and "wiped them out."</seg></seg></seg> They may, perhaps, also add 

<note type="footnote">* In addition to the labours of the regular delegate from <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> to Congress during the winter of 1871-2, there was another delegation from <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName>, composed of two Gentiles and an apostle who enjoyed the freedom of the House, and whose business it was to secure the admission of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> into the Union and thereby end all interference of Congress with the bloody record of <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">that Territory</placeName>.  The apostle was but doing his duty to "the Lord;" the two Gentile gentlemen were to be rewarded, the one with senatorial honours and the other with the position of Representative of the "State of Deseret."</note>

<note type="footnote">On one occasion the Author visited that assembled body of honoured gentlemen, and was chatting with some of them on the proposed legislation for <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> which was to bring up and investigate the <placeName type="state" key="Utah Territory">Utah</placeName> murders, and expressing surprise at the evident intention of some parties to prevent all legislation, the answer was made unreservedly by a number of gentlemen, with ill-disguised contempt: "It is a very evident, Mr. <persName key="Stenhous, Thomas B.

<seg type="Blame" subtype="EmigrantBehavior"><seg type="Blame" subtype="IndiansIndependently"><seg type="Encounter" subtype="Poison">that the emigrants poisoned a spring, and that for doing so the Indians attacked them.</seg></seg></seg>  To those who can accept such statements, in the light of the facts stated in this chapter, as a solution of the Mountain Meadows Massacre, they are perfectly welcome; but upon the Government of this great Republic, that massacre will ever be a stain until the fullest investigation has been made, and the guilty ones brought to justice.

<p><seg type="Reaction" subtype="Extra-legalViolence">Fifteen long years have passed away since that dark tragedy was enacted, and yet the nation slumbers, and the representatives of the Government are deaf to the cries of the slaughtered!  How well did Britain, a few years ago, earn the admiration of the world for the proud march of her army into the heart of Abyssinia, to demand from the infatuated Theodorus the release of British subjects!  Other nations, too, have disregarded distance, time, and money, when the cries of injured citizens have been heard calling for protection.  But here, in the very heart of "the Great Republic," on the highway between the seas, the darkest deed of the nineteenth century is passed by in silence!  <seg type="Massacre" subtype="Survivors">The cries and prayers of the orphans have been heard in vain in free America!</seg></seg></p>
