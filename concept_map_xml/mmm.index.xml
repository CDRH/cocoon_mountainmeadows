    of the dead; but the dead were not buried. From what I heard, I believe the bodies were left
    lying naked upon the ground, having been stripped of their clothing by the Indians. These
    Indians had a two horse wagon, filled with something I could not see, as blankets were carefully
    spread over the top. The wagon was driven by a white man, and beside him, there were two or

    forty others, selected from different settlements. We were addressed by the above officers, who
    told us that they had sent out Kanosh, the Pravant (sic) Chief, and his warriors, to destroy the

    of the circle rose up, but instantly fell dead and were mortally wounded, under the fire of the
    wretches who so cruelly sought their lives. Nothing remained to be done, except to kill the
    frightened females and their innocent children clasped in their arms. Others clung with
    desperation to their bleeding, dying husbands, pleading in vain for mercy at the hands of the
    "Christians" who controlled the now more savage Indian assailants. John D. Lee now sent to the
    Indian chief and men in ambush to come out and finish the survivors, directing him to spare only
    the little children who could not talk. The savages came instantly with knives drawn, and
    speedily finished the bloody work.</seg>

    and daughters, while the death blows were dealing with unflinching hands, and scalps were torn
    from heads which bloomed with beauty and innocence but a few hours before. Now the work of
    butchering ended. The murderers threw the dead into two heaps, covered them slightly with earth,
    and left them to 'feed the wolves and birds of prey.' And returned home with their blood booty
    of battle and wagons, and a great quantity of goods, &amp;c."</seg>

    of the massacre. They immediately informed me that they knew who the parties were. They stated
    that there were three, and perhaps four, companies from Arkansas, while the balance of the
    company was made up of Missourians, who fell in with them; of these latter, they knew nothing,
    but the Arkansas companies, consisted of Faziers, Camerons and the two Dunlaps, and perhaps
    Bakers. They were from the counties of Marion, Harrol and Johnson. They say when they saw them,
    they were encamped six miles from Salt Lake City, that they had been there for some time, and
    that they intended to stay there until the weather got cool enough for them to come by the South
    Pass, expecting to make a stay of eight weeks all together. Baker had not arrived there when
    they left, but as they can learn nothing from him or his company, they concluded that he had
    fallen in and decided to come into California with these companies. The two Dunlaps had each
    nine children , some of them well grown. </seg>

    me to be laid flat in a wagon and covered with blankets for two or three days, as the Indians
    were deadly hostile to all Americans; that if I was seen, it would endanger the safety of the

    with a band of some twenty Indian warriors. One of the men in company with Mr. Dame, was Mr.
    Haight, President of Cedar City. Mr. Dame said they had been out to see to the burying of the
    dead; but the dead were not buried. From what I heard, I believe the bodies were left lying
    naked upon the ground, having been stripped of their clothing by the Indians. These Indians had
    a two-horse wagon, filled with something I could not see, as blankets were carefully spread over
    the top. The wagon was driven by a white man, and beside him, there were two or three Indians in
    it! Many of them had shawls, and bundles of women's clothes were tied to their saddles. They
    were also all supplied with guns or pistols, besides bows and arrows. The hindmost Indians were
    driving several head of the emigrants' cattle. Mr. Dame and Mr. Haight, and their men, seemed to
    be on the best of terms with the Indians, and they were all in high spirits, as if they were
    mutually pleased with the accomplishment of some desired object. They thronged around us, and
    greeted us with noisy cordiality. We did not learn much from them. They passed on, and we drove
    all night in silence, and at daylight camped, and were told we were three miles beyond the scene
    of slaughter. We lay by here two or three hours, to rest, and then drove all day-twenty miles-at
    night camping on the Santa Clara River, near the Chief Jackson's village.</seg>

    out Mr. Warn as an American. The Mormon boys denied it, but the Indians were dissatisfied, and
    appeared restive. The chief came up and accused me of being an American, appeared mad, stepped
    round, shook his head, and pulled his bowstring. He then sent several men on our road ahead. Mr.
    Mathews advised us to leave there as quick as possible, as it was getting dangerous.</seg>
   <seg qtype="Source: Powers" subtype="Powers" type="Source">At Jackson's we engaged Mr. Hatch to
    go on to the Muddy as an interpreter. It was a fortunate circumstance for us that this Mr. Hatch
    arrived at our camp at the very moment that we were wishing for him most. Mr. Mathews told me he
    was an Indian missionary, and of great influence among them. He could do more with them than
    anybody else, and if he could not get me over the road, nobody could. Mr. Tanner had declared
    that he would not go on without Mr. Hatch, and pretended to be afraid of the dangers of the
    road.</seg>
   <seg qtype="Source: Powers" subtype="Powers" type="Source">Next morning Mr. Hatch left us and
    went on to the Muddy. About a day's drive the other side of the Muddy, we met him returning in
    company with two young men, brothers Young, horse thieves, who were escaping from justice in San
    Bernardino, having been assisted in getting away by those who had them in custody. Mr. Hatch
    stated that when he reached the Muddy, he found the young boys in company with an emigrant who
    had escaped the massacre-that on his arrival, there was not an Indian in sight, and that he had
    to give the whoop to call them from concealment. He said in continuation, without appearing to
    notice the discrepancy, that on his arrival he found the Indians hotly pursuing the three men,
    and that they jumped upon the emigrant, and killed him before his eyes, before he could
    interfere to prevent it. He said he threw himself between the boys and Indians, and had great
    difficulty in saving them. The Indians were in a great excitement, as he said, but that as
    Mathews and Tanner were Mormons, they could pass without danger. </seg>

    everybody. No expression of hostility to Americans was heard, but this was accounted for on the
    ground that this was a Mormon train.</seg>

   <seg qtype="Source: Warn" subtype="Warn" type="Source">On the 5th of September we encamped at
    Corn Creek. Here I had a conversation with the Indian agent, concerning the poisoning of the ox.
    He said that six Indians had died; that others were sick and would die. Upon one of them, the
    poison had worked out all over his breast, and he was dead next morning, as reported.
    Afterwards, I conversed with an Indian, said to be the war chief Ammon, who spoke good English.
    I inquired how many of his tribe had died from eating the poisoned animal. He replied not any,
    but some were sick. He did not attribute the sickness to poison, nor did he give any reason for
    it. His manner and that of all his people towards us, was not only friendly, but cordial; and he
    did not mention the train which had been doomed. Besides the Mormon train, there were camped at
    this place two or three emigrant trains, amounting to fifteen or eighteen wagons, with whom the
    Indians were as friendly as with ourselves. From Corn Creek, nothing of importance occurred more
    than is related by Mr. Powers, until we arrived at Cedar City. Here the four men, spoken of by
    Mr. Powers, (and among whom I recognized Mr. Dame) arrived at our camp; they wished to get fresh
    animals, that they might go on that night to the besieged party. This was Friday night, the
    night on which the slaughter was completed. They rested an hour or two, and took refreshments.
    In the conversation which ensued, one of our party said, 'Be careful, and don't get shot, Mr.
    Haight.' Mr. H. replied, 'We shall have no shooting;' emphasizing the we, and throwing up his
    head, as if he meant to imply that the shooting would be all over before he arrived. They left

    given to the missionaries to those Indians by Willard Richards, now dead. First they were to
    establish missions, then they would form treaties and alliances with the Indians; the elders,
    both married and single, must marry squaws, particularly the daughters of chiefs. Such ties as
    these could not be broken, and the Indians would be under their control forever. </seg>

    great service to the Saints, from their knowledge of the mountains. They were to teach the

   <seg qtype="Source: WordofMouth" subtype="WordofMouth" type="Source">In view of this fact, I went
    out this morning to see the immigrants that gave me the information, to learn further
    particulars from them. I called on but one of the families, and they informed me that in
    Arkansas they lived but three miles from Baker's farm, and that he was generally known by the
    name of Jack or "Captain Jack," Baker. He was reported to be wealthy, and left home with four
    hundred head of cattle, accompanied by his two sons. One son, named George, had spent some years
    in California, and had lived about Stockton, Sonora and Columbia. The other son was single. The
    old man intended, as soon as he could settle here, to return by water and bring out the
    remainder of his family. In his company were two brothers, by the name of Mitchel, (one of whom
    had his family,) a man named Milan Jones, and a widow named Tacket, who was coming to live with
    her son in California. I think this son is living near Tuttletown. My informants saw all these
    persons at Fort Bridger, about the last of July. Fancier (I wrote Fazier by mistake in my other
    letter) had spent some years in California, but my informant did not know in what part. They
    think the whole company had at least a thousand head of cattle with them. They also had many
    splendid rifles and guns, and plenty of them. My informants tell me, that the day they passed
    the junction of the Cut-off and the main road through Salt Lake City, (thirty miles this side of
    the city,) they saw a party of Indians enjoying a feast given them by the Mormons. The Mormons
    said they had just finished a treaty with the Indians, the purpose of which was that the Indians

    who led them on. The first of these facts is, that the young children were saved. This was no
    Indian act, but was natural for the Mormons, who wanted to train them to their faith. The second
    is, the suppression of all the names. Now, if no one of that large company did not tell his name
    to any Mormon, they certainly left some evidence among the property as to who they were and
    where they were from. The third is, the statement that the Indians had told the whites what they

    their faith. The second is, the suppression of all the names. Now, if no one of that large
    company did not tell his name to any Mormon, they certainly left some evidence among the
    property as to who they were and where they were from. The third is, the statement that the
    Indians had told the whites what they had done.</seg>

    slaughter, that convinced me that the murderers were not Indians. It may be true that Indians
    took part in the work, but the blame rests with those who led them on.</seg>

    the morning, they were suddenly fired upon from an ambush, and at the first discharge fifteen of
    the best men are said to have fallen dead or mortally wounded. To seek the shelter of their
    corral was but the work of a moment, but there they found but limited protection.</seg>
   <seg qtype="Massacre: Dates" subtype="Dates" type="Massacre">On the morning of the 10th</seg>
   <seg qtype="Massacre: Landscape" subtype="Landscape" type="Massacre">The encampment, which
    consisted of a number of tents and a corral of forty wagons and ambulances, lay on the west bank
    of, and eight or ten yards distant from, a large spring in a deep ravine running southward;
    another ravine, also, branching from this, and facing the camp on the southwest; overlooking
    them on the northwest, and within rifle-shot, rises a large mound commanding the corral, upon
    which parapets of stone, with loopholes, have been built. Yet another ravine, larger and deeper,
    faces them on the east, which could be entered without exposure from the south and far end.
    Having crept into these shelters during the darkness of the night, the cowardly assailants fired
    upon their unsuspecting victims, thus making a beginning to the most brutal butchery ever
    perpetrated on this continent.</seg>
   <seg qtype="Massacre: Battle" subtype="Battle" type="Massacre">Surrounded by superior numbers,
    and by an un- seen foe, we are told the little party stood a siege within the corral of five or
    seven days, sinking their wagon-wheels in the ground, and during the darkness of night digging
    trenches, within which to shelter their wives and children. A large spring of cool water bubbled
    up from the sand a few yards from them, but deep down in the ravine, and so well protected that
    certain death marked the trail of all who had dared approach it. The wounded were dying of
    thirst; the burning brow and parched lip marked the delirium of fever; they tossed from side to
    side with anguish; the sweet sound of the water, as it murmured along its pebbly bed, served but
    to heighten their keenest suffering. But what all this to the pang of leaving to a cruel fate
    their helpless children? Some of the little ones, who though too young to remember in after
    years, tell us that they stood by their parents, and pulled the arrows from their bleeding
    wounds.</seg>

    together; but the cries of the wounded sufferers must prevail. For the first time, they are (by
    four Mormons) offered their lives if they will lay down their arms, and gladly they avail
    themselves of the proffered mercy. Within a few hundred yards of the corral faith is broken.
    Disarmed and helpless, they are fallen upon and massacred in cold blood. The savages, who had
    been driven to the hills, are again called down to what was denominated the "job," which more
    than savage brutality had begun.</seg>

    all that remain. Upon these, some of whom had been violated by the Mormon leaders, the savage

    told that the helpless children clung around the knees of the savages, offering themselves as

    behind, it would be for their advantage to bring me through, provided I would obey council and
    the rules of the train. To this I assented, being anxious to get on, and asked what was required
    of me. Mr. Dame replied, that in passing through the Indian country, it might be necessary for
    me to be laid flat in the wagon and covered with blankets, for two or three days, as the Indians
    were deadly hostile to all Americans; that if I was seen, it would endanger the safety of the
    whole train. My friend Mr. Warn, was told that he could also go on upon the same conditions.</seg>

    and looked into the corral, and he supposed that "only five or six of the emigrants were killed
    yet." These were the words of the expressman. The same night, four men were sent out from
    Parowan, to go and learn what was the fate of the train, and, as they pretended, to save, if
    possible, some of its members.</seg>

    night previous, returning in a wagon. Mathews and Tanner held a council with them apart, and
    when they left, Mathews told me the entire train had been cut off; and as it was still dangerous
    to travel the road, they had concluded it was better for us to pass the spot in the night. We
    continued on, without much conversation, and about dusk met Mr. Dame, (I did not know that he
    had left Cedar City) and three other white men, coming from the scene of the slaughter, in
    company with a band of some twenty Indian warriors. One of the men in company with Mr. Dame, was
    Mr. Haight, President of Cedar City. Mr. Dame said they had been out to see to the burying of
    the dead; but the dead were not buried. From what I heard, I believe the bodies were left lying
    naked upon the ground, having been stripped of their clothing by the Indians. These Indians had
    a two-horse wagon; filled with something I could not see, as blankets were carefully spread over
    the top. The wagon was driven by a white man, and beside him there were two or three Indians in
    it! Many of them had shawls, and bundles of women's clothes were tied to their saddles. They
    were also all supplied with guns or pistols, besides bows and arrows. The hindmost Indians were
    driving several head of the emigrants' cattle. Mr. Dame and Mr. Haight, and their men, seemed to
    be on the best of terms with the Indians, and they were all in high spirits, as if they were
    mutually pleased with the accomplishment of some desired object. They thronged around us, and
    greeted us with noisy cordiality. We did not learn much from them. They passed on, and we drove
    all night in silence, and at daylight camped, and were told we were three miles beyond the scene
    of the slaughter. We lay by here two or three hours to rest, and then drove all day, twenty
    miles, at night camping on the Santa Clara River, near the Chief Jackson's village.</seg>

    was an Indian missionary, and of great influence among them. He could do more with them than

    Bernardino; having been assisted in getting away by those who had them in custody. Mr. Hatch
    stated, that when he reached the Muddy he found the young boys, in company with an emigrant who
    had escaped the massacre. That on his arrival, there was not an Indian in sight, and that he had
    to give the whoop to call them from concealment. He said in continuation, without appearing to
    notice the discrepancy, that on his arrived he found the Indians hotly pursuing the three men;
    and that they jumped upon the emigrant and killed him before his eyes, before he could interfere
    to prevent it. He said he threw himself between the boys and the Indians, and had great
    difficulty in saving them. The Indians were in a great excitement, as he said, but that as
    Mathews and Tanner were Mormons, they could pass without danger.</seg>

    and abuse of Mormons and Mormonism, as was reported, and these threats seemed to be made with

   <seg qtype="Source: Warn" subtype="Warn" type="Source">On the 5th of September we encamped at
    Corn Creek. Here I had conversation with the Indian agent, concerning the poisoning of the ox.
    He said that six Indians had died; that others were sick and would die. Upon one of them, the
    poison had worked out all over his breast, and he was dead next morning, as reported.
    Afterwards, I conversed with an Indian, said to be the war chief Ammon, who spoke good English.
    I inquired how many of his tribe had died from eating the poisoned animal. He replied not
    any-but some were sick. He did not attribute the sickness to poison, nor did he give any reason
    for it. His manner, and that of all his people towards us, was not only friendly, but cordial;
    and he did not mention the train which had been doomed. Besides the Mormon train, there were
    camped at this place two or three emigrants trains, amounting to fifteen or eighteen wagons,
    with whom the Indians were as friendly as with ourselves. From Corn Creek, nothing of importance
    occurred more than is related by Mr. Powers, until we arrived at Cedar City. Here the four men,
    spoken of by Mr. Powers, (and among whom I recognized Mr. Dame,) arrived at our camp; they
    wished to get fresh animals, that they might go on that night to the besieged party. This was on
    Friday night, the night on which the slaughter was completed. They rested an hour or two, and
    took refreshments. In the conversation which ensured, one our party said, 'be careful, and don't
    get shot, Mr. Haight.' Mr. H. replied, "we shall have no shooting;" emphasizing the we, and
    throwing up his head, as if he meant to imply that the shooting would be all over before he
    arrived. They left us in good spirits.</seg>

   <seg qtype="Blame: LDSGreed" subtype="LDSGreed" type="Blame">One reason that may be assigned for
    the massacre of this train, is, that it was known to be in possession of considerable valuable
    property, and this fact excited the cupidity of the Mormons. It was said, they had over 400 head
    of stock, besides mules, &amp;c. They were well supplied with arms and ammunition, an
    element of gain which enters largely into all Mormon calculations. The train was composed of
    families who all seemed to be in good circumstances, and as they were moving to California,

    yet known, are these: A train of emigrants, from Missouri and Arkansas, for this State, were
    waylayed and cruelly butchered on the route, at a place called Santa Clara Ca&#241;on, near the rim
    of the Great Basin, about 300 miles from Salt Lake city. The scene of the massacre is
    differently designated as Santa Clara Ca&#241;on, the Mountain Springs, and the Mountain Meadows. But
    all agree in locating it near the rim of the Great Basin, and about fifty miles from Cedar City,
    the most southern of the Mormon settlements. Of a party of about 130 persons, only fifteen
    infant children were saved. The account was given by the Indians themselves to the Mormons at
    Cedar City, to which place they brought the children, who were purchased from them by the people
    of that city. Whether the cause assigned is sufficient to account for the result, or whether a
    different cause is at the bottom of the transaction, we will leave the reader to form his own
    conclusion. We can scarcely believe that a party traveling along a highway would act in the
    manner described, that is to poison the carcass of an ox, and also the water, thus endangering
    the lives of those who were coming after them. Yet this is the story told by all who have spoken
    of the massacre. It is stated, the emigrants had an ox which died, and they placed poison in the
    body and also poisoned the water standing in pools, for the purpose of killing the Indians; that
    several of the tribe had died from this cause, and that the whole force mustered, pursued the
    train, and coming up with them at the above named place, which favored their purpose, attacked
    and murdered the whole party, except a few infant children. The Indians state that they made but
    one charge on the party, in which they cut off the greater portion of the men, and then guarded
    the outlets of the ca&#241;on, and shot the men and women down as they came out for water; that one
    man was making his escape with a few children, and they followed him, killed him, and took the
    children fifteen in number, the eldest under five years of age. The report was brought to San
    Bernardino by Messrs. Sidney Tanner and W. Mathews.</seg>

    these: The train camped at Corn Creek, near Fillmore City, where there is an Indian village, the
    inhabitants of which have raised a crop of wheat, and a few melons &amp;c. And in trading
    with the Indians they gave them cash for wheat, and they not knowing the value of coin were
    severely cheated. They wanted a blanket for a sack of wheat, but they gave them fifty cents, and
    told them that amount would buy a blanket. They also had an ox with them which had died, and
    they put strychnine in him, for the purpose of poisoning the Indians; and also put poison of
    some description in the water, which is standing in holes. This occasioned several deaths among
    them, within a few days after the departure of the train. And upon this, it seems, the Indians

    an old man, who lives about seven miles [out] of Salt Lake city, spoke bitterly against the
    United States, denounced Judge Drummond, and all the Federal officers, and rejoiced that the
    time had come when the saints would be avenged on their enemies-that men were found who could
    face the enemy, and that Harney, with his 2,500 men, never would enter Salt Lake city. He also
    stated that Governor Brigham Young had ordered the people to prepare for war; that they should
    not sell emigrants anything; that they must lay up provisions; that the men and women must not
    dress up in store clothes any more, but that all must be saved to forward the cause of the
    church against the common enemy-that the men must be content with buckskin instead of
    broadcloth, and have plenty of guns and ammunition.</seg>

    type="Context">For some time past, the all--engrossing topic with the people of this
    section of the State, has been the position assumed by the Mormon leaders in reference not alone
    to the people, but the Government of the United States.</seg>
   <seg qtype="Context: UtahWar" subtype="UtahWar" type="Context">We started from Leavenworth city
    on the 22d of June last. We proceeded quietly and uninterruptedly on our journey as far as Sweet
    Water. Here we saw about one hundred and fifty armed men, (all Mormon); they had established an
    observatory to watch the approach and movements of Gen. Harney's army. We was informed by them,
    that the surrounding mountains were alive with men, to watch the movements of the army. We
    understood that there would be no danger if we turned our stock out unguarded; which we found to
    be the case, because the proprietor was a Mormon. The owner gave them some beeves; and was on
    very intimate terms. We proceeded on our way as far as Fort Bridger; saw nothing of importance,
    except that several expresses passed us, to and from the various stations of their army. I
    learned nothing from any of the expresses, as they only conversed with the owner of the stock.
    We camped near Fort Bridger, I suppose about one mile and a half; saw nothing of their
    preparations, as I did not go nearer than a mile within their battlements. We proceeded to Echo
    Caon, forty miles from Salt Lake city. We saw a number of Mormon soldiers in the ca&#241;on,
    guarding that pass, secreted in the brush; they made no fires at night and said that the U.S.
    army should not pass them. They had great confidence in their allies, the Indians; they did not
    intend to meet the army in open field, but to ambush them, and the Indians were to run of the
    horses, stock, &amp;c. We next met a company of armed men, with a train of wagons loaded
    with an outfit of provisions, munitions of war, &amp;c., about twelve miles from Salt Lake
    city, on the 20th day of September, early in the morning. We learned from Dr. Dunion, surgeon to
    Brigham Young's army, that they had taken a vote at Salt Lake city, that if the United States
    army forced its way into Utah, that they themselves would burn their city, towns, forts,
    &amp;c., and lay every habitation in ashes; they had already picked out secret places in the
    mountains, to "cache" their provisions, and make their future abode with the Indians. The Doctor
    stated that arrangements were already entered into, that provided the army should enter the
    settlements, that every city, town and village in the States of California, Missouri and Iowa
    should be burned immediately--that they had men to do this who were not known to be
    Mormons! And that they would cut off all the emigrant trains, army stores, stock, &amp;c.;
    that no man, woman or child should hereafter cross the plains, without being scalped. That they
    depended and expected the Indians to perform this infernal and cowardly part of the their
    designs.</seg>
   <seg qtype="Context: UtahWar" subtype="UtahWar" type="Context">We arrived at the city in the
    afternoon of the same day. Here I found all that I had heard stated by the soldiers on their way
    out to their various stations assigned them, confirmed by the repetition of the same by the
    people of the city. I found here amongst the people of the city the most hostile feeling and
    bitter sentiments that the heart of man could possibly conceive. I was cautioned to be very
    cautious in my remarks, and say nothing against the Mormons, by a friend from Yankee land, who
    has to exercise the utmost discretion in all he said or done. Here I learned that it was
    necessary for me to get a passport form the War Department of Young's army, to secure my safety
    through the settlements, which I did, and found it very advantageous to me on my way through the
    settlements.</seg>
   <seg qtype="Context: IndianRelationsLDS" subtype="IndianRelationsLDS" type="Context">I passed
    through the principal towns on this route--being stopped by the Mormon officers and
    Indian chiefs, declaring that no American could leave the Territory without showing his
    authority and paying the Indians for the privilege; this I acceded to, by paying to the Indians
    about forty dollars, besides blankets and clothing, &amp;c. All this occurred within the
    limits of the Mormon settlements. After I left the Mormons, I got along peaceably with the
    Indians, who are not directly under Mormon influence.</seg>

    , and arriving at the field of blood, I discovered several bodies that were slain, in a state of
    nudity and a state of putrefaction. I saw about twenty wolves feasting upon the carcases [sic]
    of the murdered. Mr. Hunt shot at a wolf, they ran a few rods and halted. I noticed that the
    women and children were more generally eaten by the wild beasts than the men. Although Cap.
    Baker and a number of others of the slain party were my acquaintances, yet I dared not express
    my sentiments in the company of Hunt and his companions, knowing that I was traveling with
    enemies to my country and countrymen. Mr. Hunt and his companions often laughed, and made
    remarks derogatory to decency, and contrary to humanity, upon the persons of those who were
    there rotting, or had become food to wild beasts. Although this terrible massacre occurred
    within six miles of Painter Creek settlement, and thirty from Cedar City, yet it appears that
    the Mormons are determined to suffer their carcasses to remain uncovered, for their bones to
    bleach upon the plains.</seg>

    Indians, at the Mountain Meadows, fifty miles from Parowan, and had returned upon their road
    five miles to a spring, and fortified themselves. We then drove out of Parowan five or six
    miles, and camped at what is called the Summit.</seg>

    Mr. Dame, President of Parowan, requesting us not to proceed any further that day if we pleased;
    also that Mathews and Tanner should return to Parowan, and bring me along with them. We
    returned, and a council was held, at which it was advised by Mr. Dame, that I should go back to
    my own train, as they did not wish to have strangers in their train. He also stated, that at two
    o'clock that morning, he had received an express from the train ahead, stating they were
    surrounded by Indians, who had killed two or three of their number, and asking for assistance.
    While we were talking, an express came in from Beaver, stating that the Indians had attacked my
    train in the streets of they place, and were fighting when he left. One reason given, was that
    ten miles the other side of Beaver, an emigrant train had shot an Indian, which greatly enraged
    them; that the people of Beaver went out in the night and brought the emigrants in, and were
    followed by the Indians, who made the attack after their arrival.</seg>

    Cedar City. About the middle of the afternoon, we met the four men who were sent out the night
    previous, returning in a wagon. Mathews and Tanner held a council with them, apart, and when
    they left, Mathews told me the entire train had been cut off, and, as it was still dangerous to
    travel the road, they had concluded it was better for us to pass the spot in the night. We
    continued on, without much conversation, and about dusk met Mr. Dame, (I did not know that he
    had left Cedar City,) and three other white men, coming from the scene of slaughter, in company
    with a band of some twenty Indian warriors. One of the men in company with Mr. Dame, was Mr.
    Haight, President of Cedar City. Mr. Dame said they had been out to see to the burying of the
    dead; but the dead were not buried. From what I heard, I believe the bodies were left lying
    naked upon the ground, having been stripped of their clothing by the Indians. These Indians had
    a two-horse wagon, filled with something I could not see, as blankets were carefully spread over
    the top. The wagon was driven by a white man, and beside him, there were two or three Indians in
    it! Many of them had shawls, and bundles of women's clothes were tied to their saddles. They
    were also all supplied with guns or pistols, besides bows and arrows. The hindmost Indians were
    driving several head of the emigrants' cattle. Mr. Dame and Mr. Haight, and their men, seemed to
    be on the best of terms with the Indians, and they were all in high spirits, as if they were
    mutually pleased with the accomplishment of some desired object. They thronged around us, and
    greeted us with noisy cordiality. We did not learn much from them. They passed on, and we drove
    all night in silence, and at daylight camped, and were told we were three miles beyond the scene
    of slaughter. We lay by here two or three hours, to rest, and then drove all day-twenty miles-at
    night camping on the Santa Clara River, near the Chief Jackson's village.</seg>

    have an abundance of ammunition supplied by the Mormons, and these supplies are purchased with

    the horrible picture which was here presented to us. Human skeletons, disjointed bones, ghastly
    skulls and the hair of women, were scattered in frightful profusion over a distance of two
    miles. Three mounds, partially exposing the remains of some of the murdered, indicated the
    careless attempt that had been made to bury the unfortunate victims; we remained two or three
    hours at the Meadows, and occupied ourselves in burying the uncovered remains of the massacred.</seg>

    eyes diseased from the cruel neglect to which they had been exposed. After three days at Santa

    to their mothers, worn by the wives of John D. Lee, the Mormon Bishop of Harmony. The boy Miram,
    also identified his father's oxen, which are now owned by Lee. The two oldest boys told me that
    after they had been fighting for eight days, during four of which they were in the corral, from
    whence the water had been cut off, Bishop Hight of Cedar City, came into the corral, and told
    the emigrants that the Indians did not want anything but their cattle, and that if they would
    lay down their arms their lives would be spared. They did so, and started to go to Santa Clara,
    when they were attacked by a mixed party of whites and Indians, and all killed except the
    children. The boy Miram stated, that after the massacre was over, he saw the Bishop of Coal

   <seg qtype="Context: UtahWar" subtype="UtahWar" type="Context">RUMORS have obtained circulation
    within the last few days in Sacramento and this city that Gen. Harney and 2,500 troops, while on
    their journey to Great Salt Lake City, had been met and driven back, with a loss of 600 men. The
    rumor is so utterly baseless, and the impossibility of such a collision taking place is so
    easily perceived, that it has been universally discredited.</seg>
   <seg qtype="Context: TerritorialAdministration" subtype="TerritorialAdministration"
    type="Context">In his article on this subject this editor attempts to foreshadow the policy of
    the Administration, and the plan of action which has been decided upon by the new Governor and
    the myrmidous who accompany him on his way to Utah. If he really does reflect the policy to be
    pursued towards the people of Utah-and after making every deduction for his known
    rancor and spite we still have enough left to make us think that to some extent he
    does-the army now on their way to that Territory, is but little, if any, better than a
    mob, organized under pretence of law.</seg>
   <seg qtype="Context: TerritorialAdministration" subtype="TerritorialAdministration"
    type="Context">It is with the express and avowed purpose of waging a deathless warfare against
    "Mormonism"-the influence of Governor Young, and the union which pervades the society
    of Utah, that the new Governor and troops are going there.</seg>
   <seg qtype="Context: TerritorialAdministration" subtype="TerritorialAdministration"
    type="Context">"Governor Cumming," says this writer, "is charged with the duty of checking and
    finally overthrowing the detestable practices that prevail in Utah, and on which are balanced
    Mormonism and Young's power."</seg>
   <seg qtype="Context: Polygamy" subtype="Polygamy" type="Context">If resistance be offered, and
    the people of Utah should not submit to the inauguration of the Christian (?) practices of
    unlimited, licensed whoredom and adultery in the stead of the ancient, heaven-approving,
    bible-sustaining practice of polygamy, then the cannon and the bayonet are to be used as
    irresistible arguments in Christianizing, (?) civilizing, (?) and, if they persist in their
    resistance, victimizing the "Mormons!"</seg>
   <seg qtype="Context: TerritorialAdministration" subtype="TerritorialAdministration"
    type="Context">"Brigham is to be stripped of temporal authority, and all his actions are to be
    unremittingly watched by experienced, determined and vigilant officials, backed by an armed
    force, in point of numbers and equipment sufficient to stifle at its birth any exhibition of
    insubordination to the laws."</seg>
   <seg qtype="Context: UtahWar" subtype="UtahWar" type="Context">This coincides with the rumor
    which has reached us, that the troops now on their way to Utah boastingly and gleefully exhibit
    the ropes with which they intend to hang Governor Young and the leading "Mormons" when they
    reach Great Salt Lake City. Whether Governor Young be innocent or guilty, makes no difference;
    he must not be tried. Oh, no; it would not do to try him! That would be republican justice, and
    if it were administered, it would fail to bring about a collision between the Church and the
    troops. He must be unremittingly watched by vigilant spies wearing the garb of U.S. officials.</seg>
   <seg qtype="Context: Polygamy" subtype="Polygamy" type="Context">"The incoming of the new regime
    will be the entering wedge towards casting down the institution of polygamy." This remark is
    tantamount to a confession that this institution is too impregnably fortified by scripture and
    reason for any cogent arguments, or moral suasion to be brought to bear against it; and,
    therefore, resort must be had to brute force-artillery, cavalry and infantry!</seg>
   <seg qtype="Context: LDSPersecution" subtype="LDSPersecution" type="Context">How indicative it is
    of the degeneracy of the age, and the absence of the spirit of liberty, when an editor can
    unblushingly and publicly declare in these free States that the day has come when the
    inhabitants of a U.S. Territory can no longer have the right to enjoy liberty of
    conscience-to declare that 100,000 freemen must frame their creed and practice their
    religion according to the ideas of half-a-dozen politicians, who by hook or by crook have
    contrived to get appointed to the Federal offices in that Territory, or be visited by the full
    weight of the resources of the General Government! Such an indignity was never offered to the
    Thirteen Colonies by the tyrannical ministers of the third George. For less than this, and other
    indignities and wrongs which we have endured, the colonists declared themselves free and
    independent, and broke the yoke which the tyrants sought to impose upon them; and shall
    freemen-men reared under the shade of the tree of liberty, sons of those revolters
    against oppression, and in whose breasts the spirit of freedom was born, "grown with their
    growth and strengthened with their strength"-do less?</seg>
   <seg qtype="Context: LDSPersecution" subtype="LDSPersecution" type="Context">We have not
    encroached on the rights or privileges of any; but we have been encroached upon. We have
    submitted to it. Not once or twice, but repeatedly. When smoke on one cheek, we have turned
    again and again the other to the smiter. To escape from this oppression we were willing to exile
    ourselves in a far-off wilderness-a country so sterile and repelling that no other
    people would occupy it; but have we been permitted to dwell there unmolested? We were while
    there were crickets to fight-while starvation and want stared us in the face, and the
    prospect was promising of our having to succumb to them. But no sooner had we reared comfortable
    homes, demonstrated that the country was inhabitable, and surrounded ourselves with the
    appliances of civilized life and comparative wealth, than the old system of oppression was
    re-commenced; and at last, the unceasing efforts of our oppressors have succeed in persuading
    the Administration to lend itself to the scheme of crushing out a people who have ever been
    loyal subjects, and who have done more during the last ten years towards developing the
    resources of the country and adding to the conveniences of traveling than any other community of
    thrice its size!</seg>
   <seg qtype="Context: UtahWar" subtype="UtahWar" type="Context">The determination evidently is
    that we shall renounce our so-called errors, or be exterminated. The word extermination is not
    used in the article above referred to-though it has been used time and again in other
    articles on this subject-but accepting the language used at its standard meaning, it
    is as plain as a pikestaff that this is the result which we may expect, if the policy adopted
    can be successfully carried out and Harney's troops do not all desert him before he reaches
    Utah. If rumor may be relied on, and we have it from accredited sources, they have commenced
    putting their plan of operations into effect on the plains-pressing Mormon emigrants
    into their service, oppressing the men and abusing and practicing their devilish arts upon the
    women.</seg>
   <seg qtype="Context: LDSPersecution" subtype="LDSPersecution" type="Context">But if the collision
    be forced upon them-if the determination be to compel them to cease the practice of
    their religion-to deprive them of their rights and privileges as freemen-to
    make them slaves in fact-then we, were we in Utah, would say, Let it come; with God to
    defend the right, we will risk the consequences. We would say, Let the rugged defiles of the
    Rocky Mountains become a second Thermopyl&#230; where the sons of illustrious sires will contend of
    the precious rights bought by the blood of their fathers and bequeathed to them as the most
    inestimable boon they could bestow. We would say, That rather than part with our religion, we,
    with God's assistance, will part with life; rather than live a slave-to fawn and
    cringe and bend the knee at another's beck-to endure the slavery of the mind, a
    slavery far more ignoble and debasing than the slavery of the body, we will die, nobly
    contending for the God-given right of freedom of conscience. Better far do this, than tamely
    stand by and be robbed of our dearest rights or suffer extermination; for if we should fall,
    others might live, and be victorious, and our children could then enjoy what we had contended
    for. These are our feelings to-day, and we pray God they may ever be; we wish no other. We
    boldly avow them, confident that they will meet the approval of every friend of justice and
    liberty.</seg>

    incredible, and utterly inconsistent with civilized human nature, in these editors' view of the
    case, for the emigrants to cheat the Indians, or to poison their water and the carcase of an ox.
    This is too hard a story to believe. But mark the difference, when there exists the slightest

    this kind, when they know they are as innocent of it as the child unborn-and when they
    know, also, that their accusers are no more warranted by the evidence before them in accusing
    them, than they would be in fastening a similar charge on the inhabitants of San Francisco? As
    if the feelings of the people were not already sufficiently hostile against the people of
    Deseret, a venal and incendiary press must seek to add fuel to the flame, and raise a feeling of
    embittered hated against "Mormonism" and the "Mormons" in the breast of every man who will be
    influenced by them, or who will not take the trouble to think and investigate for themselves.
    What cause is there for wonder at our talking as plainly and independently as we do, when this
    persistent determination on their part of fasten upon us the commission of the most foul and
    unnatural crimes, regardless of all evidence and all our protestations of innocence, is
    sufficient to finally extinguish it. And the instance above is only one out of a numerous list
    that might be adduced; it is but another illustration of that utter disregard of justice and
    honor which has been continually exhibited by journalists and others in their treatment of the
    "Mormons." How long they expect we can endure such things, and not arise and resent them, we do
    not know; but such creatures may yet learn that there is a limit even to Mormon forbearance and

    If blood be shed, if a collision take place, and a war be commenced, a large share of the blame
    must fall upon the heads of leaders of public journals throughout the country. They have done

    administrators of those laws. They have never experienced such treatment as they ought, in
    common justice, to have received. They have been abused, vilified and wronged in the most
    outrageous manner-called murderers, thieves and every thing else that was vile, and
    not only called but treated as such-until the people have almost persuaded themselves

  <title>Killing of Immigrants-Mormons falsely Accused-Further Endurance no

  <source>Western Standard</source>
  <date>November 6, 1857</date>
  <note> George Q. Cannon's first published response to the news of the Mountain Meadows Massacre.
   Cannon believes Gentile "rascals" may have disguised themselves as Indians to throw suspicion on
   the Mormons for the massacre. </note>

   <seg qtype="Coverage: LDS" subtype="LDS" type="Coverage">AFTER this, we presume, there will not
    be a white man killed, or an emigrant train attacked between the Sierra Nevada and the Western
    or Southern States, on any route, at what will be credited to the Mormon. They may be as
    innocent as angels, but that will make no difference; the determination is apparent to heap upon
    them the odium of eve ry such deed. The published estimate of the man, Abbot, which has obtained
    considerable circulation lately, is, that the Mormons and Indians have killed five hundred
    immigrants on the road between Salt Lake and California during this year alone. Trains have been
    attacked by Indians led on by white men, and the white men were, of course, concluded to be
    Mormons. One statement says, that they were known to be Mormons, because they swore. The
    statement made by Mr. Hones, who came by way of the Southern Utah route, via San Bernardino, and
    whose testimony is adduced as evidence that the Mormons were the instigators, if not the
    perpetrators of the massacre at Mountain Meadows-goes to prove that the Mormons were
    distinguished from the Gentiles, by the Indians on that route, by their swearing. This person
    says that the Mormon interpreters urged them to refrain from swearing, as the Indians would know
    that they were not Mormons, if they did not take this precaution. The swearing therefore of
    those whose men who were among the Indians on the Northern route, is not an evidence that they
    were Mormons, but rather that they were Gentiles; moreover, it is preposterous to suppose that,
    if they were Mormons, they would let expressions drop, such as we see reported that immigrants
    have heard, which would lead those whom they attacked to recognize them as Mormons. If they were
    Mormons disguised as Indians, and they considered such disguise necessary for the concealment of
    their identity, they would be very sure to let nothing escape them that would cause suspicion to
    fall upon them; but if they were rascals who wished suspicion to be diverted from themselves and
    to fall upon the Mormons, it is quite reasonable to suppose that the would disguise themselves
    as Indians, and also be sure to let some expression fall from them that would lead those whom
    they assailed and whose minds were already filled with suspicion and fear about the Utah, to
    suppose that the Mormons were leading on and instigating the Indians to plunder and murder them.</seg>

    happened it that they were assisted by the Mormons, escorted into their fort when attacked by
    Indians, protected and guided by them through the exasperated red men; when to all their other
    motives for murder was added the additional one of concealment? Had they killed or caused to be
    killed the first train for the motives assigned, who would think, if they would reflect upon it

    differing materially from that which he had already published; and, perhaps, he would insert it
    in his next issue. Scarcely a paper that has published all the statements from which this
    materially differed, has noticed the existence of such a statement. Coming from San Bernardino,
    it must be justificatory of the Mormons, and, therefore, must be ignored.-Every other
    accused party may have the benefit of a doubt; but a Mormon-Never. They are fearful
    that the unfavorable impressions which they wish made on the public mind in respect to the
    Mormons, should be weakened; therefore, every statement that would increase the hatred of the
    masses against "Mormonism" and the carefully published, and duly compiled in the summary of news
    sent on the steamer to the East; but the exculpatory evidence is not once alluded
    to.-This was the course the pursued with the Drummond slanders, until their author's
    character was so completely exposed that he was a stench in the nose of every virtuous man. And
    when the time arrives, as it most assuredly will, that the utter falsity of those charges will

  <segs>
   <seg qtype="Context: UtahWar" subtype="UtahWar" type="Context">THE news brought from the East by
    the John L. Stephens relative to the Mormon question, is of a nature somewhat similar to that
    which has been going the rounds of the Press for two months past. There is nothing particularly
    new or starling. A letter from Fort Kearney, under date of Sept. 5th, states that two companies
    of troops arrived there on that day en route to Great Salt Lake City, and that the 5th and 10th
    regiments had reached Fort Laramie; where we hope they will stay. We hear nothing about Gen.
    Harney or the new Governor. By the last mail it as reported that they were to leave Leavenworth
    at a certain time; but we can learn nothing by this mail of their departure.</seg>
   <seg qtype="Context: UtahWar" subtype="UtahWar" type="Context">Returning Californians informed
    the writer of the letter alluded to above, that the Mormons were making preparations for a
    fight, and did not conceal their movements. The report also is that they are fortifying Fort
    Bridger, and are, determined to make a stand there. Editors and letter writers find it difficult
    to believe, however, that Governor Young, is so "insane"-so they term it-as
    to make an armed resistance to the U.S. troops when they shall arrive in the Territory of Utah.
    They can not persuade themselves that he would take steps which would bring down upon him the
    "strong arm of the Federal Government." </seg>
   <seg qtype="Context: LDSPersecution" subtype="LDSPersecution" type="Context">We have heard Mormon
    bluster before. When the Church was expelled from Missouri, where even to this day it is
    believed by them that the stakes of Zion have been set, weak in numbers though it was, the
    inhuman atrocities perpetrated by the border people should certainly have aroused a spirit of
    resistance, and prompted the defense of wives and children, had a defensive attitude been
    advisable. So also when the leader and prophet Smith was killed at Carthage, Illinois, his death
    it was predicted would create civil war; but they went not to battle, and have ever since been
    growing stronger for it. When they broke up their establishment at Nauvoo, and turned their
    faces toward the wilderness, instead of evincing a vindictive and hostile feeling toward the
    U.S. Government, they responded to its call for volunteers, and enrolled a large number of their
    young men in a battalion for service in this country during the Mexican war. Thus it will be
    seen their policy has been from the beginning, non-resistance.</seg>
   <seg qtype="Context: LDSPersecution" subtype="LDSPersecution" type="Context">We have suffered
    oppression and wrong-numberless inhuman atrocities have been perpetrated upon us,
    which should have aroused a spirit of resistance, if such a spirit could be stirred up under any
    circumstances; but we submitted, and did not suffer a vindictive or retaliatory policy to
    actuate us, and, therefore, they think that we will still permit such a course to be
    unresistingly pursued toward us. The fact is, those who have been loudest in their denunciations
    of the Mormons, and who have sought most diligently to blacken their character and to charge
    them with the commission of deeds of the most aggressive and vindictive nature, know full well
    that the Mormons, even when goaded to the utmost extent of human endurance, by the oppressive
    acts of their enemies, never suffered feelings of revenge to urge them to overstep the laws and
    Constitution.</seg>
   <seg qtype="Context: UtahWar" subtype="UtahWar" type="Context">What preparations have been made
    by the people of Deseret to defend themselves, or whether any have been made, we know not. But
    men deceive themselves when they think that their expressed determinations are but idle bravado,
    and that they will continue to suffer as they have heretofore done from the beginning, without
    making any effort to save themselves.</seg>
   <seg qtype="Context: LDSPersecution" subtype="LDSPersecution" type="Context">Isolated though the
    people of Deseret have been, and shut out for a greater part of the year from the outside world,
    yet they have known the plans which have been concocted in secret chambers for their
    destruction, and they have made their preparations to anticipate them. They have been aware for
    some time that schemes have been suggested and put into operation for their destruction.
    Scarcely was James Buchanan seated in the Presidential chair than the policy to be pursued
    towards the Mormons and the settlement of that vexed question, was decided upon. We heard an
    inkling of it some time ago in this country, and it came from authentic sources-from
    those who were no doubt acquainted with the whole plot; but we could scarcely credit it.
    Subsequent events, however, and the open avowals and acknowledgements of those who had every
    opportunity of knowing what the policy really was, and the undisguised delight they manifested
    at the anticipated success of the undertaking, have fully revealed and confirmed it. The plan
    was, to put an end to the Mormon question for ever by introducing division and strife in the
    midst of the people-by seducing them from their religion-by depriving the
    authorities of the church of their power, and, if the slightest pretext could be found, of their
    lives-by prohibiting polygamy, and by the introduction in its stead of the gentile
    practices of adultery and whoredom; if these things would not break up and annihilate the
    system, then the utter extermination of the people, it was thought, would do it. That this was
    the plan decided upon, there is no longer any room to doubt. If it could be carried out, thought
    its originators, it would be completely successful in solving the Mormon problem.</seg>

    there; for if that were the object for which the expedition had been planned, when the
    Administration was put in possession of evidence showing that the troops were not needed in
    Deseret for any such purpose, it would have been stopped and the expenditure of a large amount
